An application of this last result to information manifolds is considered.

Current solution techniques relax this problem to a weighted, nearest, (positive) semidefinite programming, SDP, completion problem, by using the linear mapping between Euclidean distance matrices, EDM, and semidefinite matrices. The resulting SDP is solved using primal-dual interior point solvers, yielding an expensive and inexact solution. This relaxation is highly degenerate in the sense that the feasible set is restricted to a low dimensional face of the SDP cone, implying that the Slater constraint qualification fails. Cliques in the graph of the SNL problem give rise to this degeneracy in the SDP relaxation. In this paper, we take advantage of the absence of the Slater constraint qualification and derive a technique for the SNL problem, with exact data, that explicitly solves the corresponding rank restricted SDP problem. No SDP solvers are used. For randomly generated instances, we are able to efficiently solve many huge instances of this NP-hard problem to high accuracy, by finding a representation of the minimal face of the SDP cone that contains the SDP matrix representation of the EDM. The main work of our algorithm consists in repeatedly finding the intersection of subspaces that represent the faces of the SDP cone that correspond to cliques of the SNL problem.", "subjects": "Optimization and Control (math.OC)", "authors": "Nathan Krislock, Henry Wolkowicz,", "date": "2010-1-29"},

A geometric analogue is the distortion of the (Riemannian) metric of a (Lie) subgroup when compared to the metric induced from the ambient (Lie) group. The distortion of a subalgebra in an algebra also reflects the degree of complexity of the membership problem for the elements of this algebra in this subalgebra.

We have recently proposed a fast algorithm, called Smoothed (SL0), for this task. Contrary to many other sparse recovery algorithms, SL0 is not based on minimizing the norm, but it tries to directly minimize the norm of the solution. The basic idea of SL0 is optimizing a sequence of certain (continuous) cost functions approximating the norm of a vector.

Two families of precoders are studied: random iid precoders and orthogonal precoders. We analyse their performance in the regime where both the number of sensors k and the number of samples n per sensor tend to infinity at the same rate, that is, k/n tends to c in (0, 1). Contributions are as follows. 1) Using results of random matrix theory and on large Toeplitz matrices, it is proved that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson detector converges exponentially to zero, when the above families of precoders are used. Closed form expressions of the corresponding error exponents are provided. 2) In particular, we propose a practical orthogonal precoding strategy, the Principal Frequencies Strategy (PFS), which achieves the best error exponent among all orthogonal strategies, and which requires very few signaling overhead between the central processor and the nodes of the network. 3) Moreover, when the PFS is used, a simplified low-complexity testing procedure can be implemented at the FC.

Recently, the duality of conformally flat Riemannian manifolds was found by several geometers. In our setting, this duality can be explained via the existence of a two-fold map of the congruent classes of admissible GCF-manifolds into that of frontals in H^. It should be remarked that the dual conformally flat metric may have degenerate points even when the original conformally flat metric is positive definite. This is the reason why we consider conformally flat manifolds with singular points. In fact, the duality is an involution on the set of admissible GCF-manifolds. The case n=2 requires an exceptional treatment, since any Riemannian 2-manifolds are conformally flat.

This model, known as the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of wireless medium and interference. Avestimehr et al. showed that the Min-cut Max-flow theorem holds in the ADT network. In this paper, we show that the ADT network model can be described within the algebraic network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove that the ADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, called the \"system matrix\". We show that the min-cut of an ADT network is the rank of the system matrix; thus, eliminating the need to optimize over exponential number of cuts between two nodes to compute the min-cut of an ADT network. We extend the capacity characterization for ADT networks to a more general set of connections. Our algebraic approach not only provides the Min-cut Max-flow theorem for a single unicast/multicast connection, but also extends to non-multicast connections such as multiple multicast, disjoint multicast, and two-level multicast. We also provide sufficiency conditions for achievability in ADT networks for any general connection set. In addition, we show that the random linear network coding, a randomized distributed algorithm for network code construction, achieves capacity for the connections listed above. Finally, we extend the ADT networks to those with random erasures and cycles (thus, allowing bi-directional links). Note that ADT network was proposed for approximating the wireless networks; however, ADT network is acyclic. Furthermore, ADT network does not model the stochastic nature of the wireless links.

To begin with, we find a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic causal rate-distortion function (RDF) under such distortion measure, denoted by , for first-order Gauss-Markov processes. Rc^(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) by any causal source code, namely Rc^(D). We show that, for Gaussian sources, the latter can also be upper bounded as Rc^(D) leq Rc^(D) + 0.5 log_(2 pi e) bits/sample. In order to analyze for arbitrary zero-mean Gaussian stationary sources, we introduce bar(D), the information-theoretic causal RDF when the reconstruction error is jointly stationary with the source. Based upon bar(D), we derive three closed-form upper bounds to the additive rate loss defined as bar(D) - R(D), where R(D) denotes Shannon's RDF. Two of these bounds are strictly smaller than 0.5 bits/sample at all rates. These bounds differ from one another in their tightness and ease of evaluation; the tighter the bound, the more involved its evaluation. We then show that, for any source spectral density and any positive distortion D leq sigma_^, bar(D) can be realized by an AWGN channel surrounded by a unique set of causal pre-, post-, and feedback filters. We show that finding such filters constitutes a convex optimization problem.

The transmitter is assumed to comprise a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, that minimizes the front-end imposed transmit energy penalty. Focusing on discrete complex input alphabets, the energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet to a larger alphabet set prior to precoding. For the common discrete lattice-based relaxation, the problem is found to violate the assumption of replica symmetry and a replica symmetry breaking ansatz is taken. The limiting empirical distribution of the precoder's output, as well as the limiting energy penalty, are derived for one-step replica symmetry breaking. For convex relaxations, replica symmetry is found to hold and corresponding results are obtained for comparison. Particularizing to a \"zero-forcing\" (ZF) linear front-end, and non-cooperative users, a decoupling result is derived according to which the channel observed by each of the individual receivers can be effectively characterized by the Markov chain u-x-y, where u, x, and y are the channel input, the equivalent precoder output, and the channel output, respectively. For discrete lattice-based alphabet relaxation, the impact of replica symmetry breaking is demonstrated for the energy penalty at the transmitter. An analysis of spectral efficiency is provided to compare discrete lattice-based relaxations against convex relaxations, as well as linear ZF and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Focusing on quaternary phase shift-keying (QPSK), significant performance gains of both lattice and convex relaxations are revealed compared to linear ZF precoding, for medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

The goal is to allow for a reduced delay collection by a data collector who accesses the network at a random position and random time. Data dissemination is performed by a set of relays which form a circular route to exchange source packets. The storage nodes within the transmission range of the route's relays linearly combine and store overheard relay transmissions using random decentralized strategies. An intelligent data collector first collects a minimum set of coded packets from a subset of storage nodes in its proximity, which might be sufficient for recovering the original packets and, by using a message-passing decoder, attempts recovering all original source packets from this set. Whenever the decoder stalls, the source packet which restarts decoding is polled/doped from its original source node. The random-walk-based analysis of the decoding/doping process furnishes the collection delay analysis with a prediction on the number of required doped packets. The number of doped packets can be surprisingly small when employed with an Ideal Soliton code degree distribution and, hence, the doping strategy may have the least collection delay when the density of source nodes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we demonstrate that network coding makes dissemination more efficient at the expense of a larger collection delay. Not surprisingly, a circular network allows for a significantly more (analytically and otherwise) tractable strategies relative to a network whose model is a random geometric graph.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Silvija Kokalj-Filipovic, Predrag Spasojevic, Emina Soljanin,", "date": "2010-1-21"},

In all three protocols, we assume no cooperation across relay nodes for encoding and decoding. Numerical evaluation in illustrative example networks and comparison with cheap relay cut-set bounds for half-duplex networks show that the proposed MDF protocols approach capacity in some ranges of channel gains. The main idea in the design of the protocols is the use of coding in interference networks that are created in different states or modes of a half-duplex network.

In this paper, we give a complete solution to the problem of existence and uniqueness of monotone waves in the KPP-Fisher equation. We show that each monotone traveling wave can be found via an iteration procedure. The proposed approach is based on the use of special monotone integral operators (which are different from the usual Wu-Zou operator) and appropriate upper and lower solutions associated to them. The analysis of the asymptotic expansions of the eventual traveling fronts at infinity is another key ingredient of our approach.", "subjects": "Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)", "authors": "Adrian Gomez, Sergei Trofimchuk,", "date": "2010-1-20"},

We extend this notion to the lossy compression regime assuming a feedforward link is available, by modeling a source via a two-dimensional symbolic dynamical system where one component corresponds to the compressed signal, and the other essentially corresponds to the feedforward signal. For memoryless sources and an arbitrary bounded distortion measure, we show this approach leads to a family of simple deterministic compression schemes that attain the rate-distortion function of the source.

There are numerous applications for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels. Recently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for DPC. In lattice-based DPC, there are two codes - a convolutional code that defines a lattice used for shaping and an error correction code used for channel coding. Several specific designs have been reported in the recent literature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching shaping and coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder works on a joint trellis of shaping and channel codes or the decoder requires iterations between the shaping and channel decoders. This results in high complexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC scheme that provides good shaping and coding gains with moderate complexity at both the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit shaping, and a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The crucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of the bits at the transmitter, which enable an LDPC decoder to be run first at the receiver. This provides gains without the need for iterations between the shaping and channel decoders. Simulation results confirm that at high rates the proposed DPC method performs close to capacity with moderate complexity. As an application of the proposed DPC method, we show a design for superposition coding that provides rates better than time-sharing over a Gaussian broadcast channel.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "G Shilpa, Andrew Thangaraj, Srikrishna Bhashyam,", "date": "2010-1-20"},

The network is assumed to transport n packets from source to each receiver, and the adversary is allowed to eavesdrop on mu arbitrarily chosen links and also to inject up to t erroneous packets into the network. The goal of the system is to achieve zero-error communication that is information-theoretically secure from the adversary. Moreover, this goal must be attained in a universal fashion, i.e., regardless of the network topology or the underlying network code. An upper bound on the achievable rate under these requirements is shown to be n- mu-2t packets per transmission. A scheme is proposed that can achieve this maximum rate, for any n and any field size q, provided the packet length m is at least n symbols. The scheme is based on rank-metric codes and admits low-complexity encoding and decoding. In addition, the scheme is shown to be optimal in the sense that the required packet length is the smallest possible among all universal schemes that achieve the maximum rate.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Danilo Silva, Frank R.

At the asymmetric co-existence level, the secondary network selectively deactivates its users based on knowledge of the interference and channel gains, whereas at the symmetric level, the primary network also schedules its users in the same way. Our aim is to derive optimal sum-rates (i.e., throughputs)of both networks at each co-existence level as the number of users grows asymptotically and evaluate how the sum-rates scale with network size. In order to find the asymptotic throughput results, we derive a key lemma on extreme order statistics and a proposition on the sum of lower order statistics. As a baseline comparison, we calculate the sum-rates for channel sharing via time-division (TD). We compare the asymptotic secondary sum-rate in TD with that under simultaneous transmission, while ensuring the primary network maintains the same throughput in both cases. The results indicate that simultaneous transmission at both asymmetric and symmetric co-existence levels can outperform TD.

Joseph invented multidegrees in [Jo84] to study orbital varieties, which are the components of an orbital scheme, itself constructed by intersecting a nilpotent orbit with a Borel subalgebra. Their multidegrees, known as Joseph polynomials, give a basis of a (Springer) representation of the Weyl group. In the case of the nilpotent orbit , the orbital varieties can be indexed by noncrossing chord diagrams in the disc. In this paper we study the normal cone to the orbital scheme inside this nilpotent orbit . This gives a better-motivated construction of the Brauer loop scheme we introduced in [KZJ07], whose components are indexed by all chord diagrams (now possibly with crossings) in the disc. The multidegrees of its components, the Brauer loop varieties, were shown to reproduce the ground state of the Brauer loop model in statistical mechanics [DFZJ06]. Here, we reformulate and slightly generalize these multidegrees in order to express them as solutions of the rational quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation associated to the Brauer algebra. In particular, the vector of the multidegrees satisfies two sets of equations, corresponding to the and generators of the Brauer algebra. We describe here the geometric meaning of both and equations in our slightly extended setting.

Nevertheless, the recent progress in this topic suggests a definitive option for , which is developed here in detail. Our study has two parts: (I) To give general arguments on a boundary in order to ensure that it is admissible as a causal boundary at the three natural levels, i.e., as a point set, as a chronological space and as a topological space. Then, the essential uniqueness of our choice is stressed, and the relatively few admissible alternatives are discussed. (II) To analyze the role of the conformal boundary . We show that, in general, may present a very undesirable structure. Nevertheless, it is well-behaved under certain general assumptions, and its accessible part agrees with the causal boundary. This study justifies both boundaries.

The stopping time of algebraic gossip is known to be linear for the complete graph, but the question of determining a tight upper bound or lower bounds for general graphs is still open. We take a major step in solving this question, and prove that algebraic gossip on any graph of size n is O(D*n) where D is the maximum degree of the graph. This leads to a tight bound of Theta(n) for bounded degree graphs and an upper bound of O(n^2) for general graphs. We show that the latter bound is tight by providing an example of a graph with a stopping time of Omega(n^2).

The CB average beampattern expresses a deterministic behavior and can be used for characterizing/controling the transmission at intended direction(s), since the mainlobe of the CB beampattern is independent on the particular random node locations. However, the CB for a cluster formed by a limited number of collaborative nodes results in a sample beampattern with sidelobes that severely depend on the particular node locations. High level sidelobes can cause unacceptable interference when they occur at directions of unintended BSs/APs. Therefore, sidelobe control in CB has a potential to increase the network capacity and wireless channel availability by decreasing the interference. Traditional sidelobe control techniques are proposed for centralized antenna arrays and, therefore, are not suitable for WSNs. In this paper, we show that distributed, scalable, and low-complexity sidelobe control techniques suitable for CB in WSNs can be developed based on node selection technique which make use of the randomness of the node locations. A node selection algorithm with low-rate feedback is developed to search over different node combinations.

The current methods of flow estimation, based on Darcy's Law and the groundwater flow equation, can be described by the diffusion equation (the transient flow) and the Laplace equation (the steady-state flow). The Laplace equation is a simplification of the diffusion equation under the condition that the aquifer has a recharging boundary. The practical way of calculation is to use numerical methods to solve these equations. The most popular system is called MODFLOW, which was developed by USGS. MODFLOW is based on the finite-difference method in rectangular Cartesian coordinates. MODFLOW can be viewed as a \"quasi 3D\" simulation since it only deals with the vertical average (no z-direction derivative). Flow calculations between the 2D horizontal layers use the concept of leakage. In this project, we have established a mathematical model based on gradually varied functions for groundwater data volume reconstruction. These functions do not rely on the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system. A gradually varied function can be defined in a general graph or network. Gradually varied functions are suitable for arbitrarily shaped aquifers. Two types of models are designed and implemented for real data processing: (1) the gradually varied model for individual (time) groundwater flow data, (2) the gradually varied model for sequential (time) groundwater flow data.

In stark contrast, when there is channel information at the sensors, the gain in error exponent due to having multiple antennas at the fusion center is shown to be no more than a factor of (8/pi) for Rayleigh fading channels between the sensors and the fusion center, independent of the number of antennas at the fusion center, or correlation among noise samples across sensors. Scaling laws for such gains are also provided when both sensors and antennas are increased simultaneously. Simple practical schemes and a numerical method using semidefinite relaxation techniques are presented that utilize the limited possible gains available.

A discrete Helmholtz decomposition of the functions in the velocity space based on potentials taken from the pressure space is used to provide a complete description of the numerical wave propagation for the discretised equations. In the -plane case, this decomposition is used to obtain decoupled equations for the geostrophic modes, the inertia-gravity modes, and the inertial oscillations. As has been noticed previously, the geostrophic modes are steady. The Helmholtz decomposition is used to show that the resulting inertia-gravity wave equation is third-order accurate in space. In general the pdgp finite element pair is second-order accurate, so this leads to very accurate wave propagation. It is further shown that the only spurious modes supported by this discretisation are spurious inertial oscillations which have frequency , and which do not propagate. The Helmholtz decomposition also allows a simple derivation of the quasi-geostrophic limit of the discretised - equations in the -plane case, resulting in a Rossby wave equation which is also third-order accurate.", "subjects": "Numerical Analysis (math.NA)", "authors": "C.

The next step in this program of rigorous approximation is to determine whether coding schemes for discrete superposition models can be lifted to Gaussian relay networks with a bounded rate loss independent of SNR. We establish precisely this property and show that the superposition model can thus serve as a strong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks. We show that a code for a Gaussian relay network, with a single source-destination pair and multiple relay nodes, can be designed from any code for the corresponding discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. In comparison to the rate of the discrete superposition network's code, the rate of the Gaussian network's code only reduces at most by a constant that is a function only of the number of nodes in the network and independent of channel gains. This result is also applicable for coding schemes for MIMO Gaussian relay networks, with the reduction depending additionally on the number of antennas.

We argue that, as opposed to channel coding, the correct sequence from the list produced by the list decoder can effectively be recovered in case of SCSI, since we are dealing with a virtual noisy channel rather than a real noisy channel.

One significant drawback, however, is that for current constructions the probability of error decays sub-exponentially in the block-length (more detailed designs improve the probability of error at the cost of significantly increased computational complexity cite). In this work we show how the the classical idea of code concatenation -- using \"short\" polar codes as inner codes and a \"high-rate\" Reed-Solomon code as the outer code -- results in substantially improved performance. In particular, code concatenation with a careful choice of parameters boosts the rate of decay of the probability of error to almost exponential in the block-length with essentially no loss in computational complexity.

Although many works have shown the potential benefits of network MIMO, the conclusion critically depends on the underlying assumptions such as channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) and backhaul links. In this paper, by focusing on the impact of partial CSIT, we propose an outage-efficient strategy. Namely, with side information of all UT's messages and local CSIT, each BS applies zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in a distributed manner. For a small number of UTs (), the ZF beamforming creates parallel MISO channels. Based on the statistical knowledge of these parallel channels, the CS performs a robust power allocation that simultaneously minimizes the outage probability of all UTs and achieves a diversity gain of per UT. With a large number of UTs (), we propose a so-called distributed diversity scheduling (DDS) scheme to select a subset of UTs with limited backhaul communication. It is proved that DDS achieves a diversity gain of , which scales optimally with the number of cooperative BSs as well as UTs.

Recently, we proposed a local neighborhood search algorithm, namely `reactive tabu search' (RTS) algorithm, as well as a factor-graph based `belief propagation' (BP) algorithm for low-complexity large-MIMO detection. The motivation for the present work arises from the following two observations on the above two algorithms: RTS works for general M-QAM. Although RTS was shown to achieve close to optimal performance for 4-QAM in large dimensions, significant performance improvement was still possible for higher-order QAM (e.g., 16- and 64-QAM). ii) BP also was shown to achieve near-optimal performance for large dimensions, but only for alphabet. In this paper, we improve the large-MIMO detection performance of higher-order QAM signals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs RTS and BP. In particular, motivated by the observation that when a detection error occurs at the RTS output, the least significant bits (LSB) of the symbols are mostly in error, we propose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other than LSBs at the RTS output and feed the interference cancelled received signal to the BP algorithm to improve the reliability of the LSBs. The output of the BP is then fed back to RTS for the next iteration. Our simulation results show that in a 32 x 32 V-BLAST system, the proposed RTS-BP algorithm performs better than RTS by about 3.5 dB at uncoded BER and by about 2.5 dB at rate-3/4 turbo coded BER with 64-QAM at the same order of complexity as RTS.

Our results show that cooperation will lead to higher stable throughput rates than conventional retransmission policies and that the use of random linear network coding at the relay can further increase the stable throughput with increasing Network Coding field size or number of packets over which encoding is performed.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Anthony Fanous, Anthony Ephremides,", "date": "2010-1-13"},

This enables the proposed transceiver to outperform the previously derived limited feedback MU linear transceivers. Second, we remove dimensionality constraints on the MIMO system, for the scenario with multiple data streams per user, using a combination of maximum expected signal combining (MESC) and minimum MSE receiver. This makes the feedback of each user independent of the others and the resulting feedback overhead scales linearly with the number of data streams instead of the number of receiving antennas.

Similarly, we prove that non-connective algebraic K-theory is the universal localizing invariant, i.e., the universal functor that moreover satisfies the \"Thomason-Trobaugh-Neeman\" localization theorem. To prove these results, we construct and study two stable infinity categories of \"noncommutative motives\"; one associated to additivity and another to localization. In these stable infinity categories, Waldhausen's S. construction corresponds to the suspension functor and connective and non-connective algebraic K-theory spectra become corepresentable by the noncommutative motive of the sphere spectrum. In particular, the algebraic K-theory of every scheme, stack, and ring spectrum can be recovered from these categories of noncommutative motives. In order to work with these categories of noncommutative motives, we establish comparison theorems between the category of spectral categories localized at the Morita equivalences and the category of small idempotent-complete stable infinity categories. We also explain in detail the comparison between the infinity categorical version of Waldhausen K-theory and the classical definition.

However, the restoration of these images using state-of-the-art regularizers (such as those based on multiscale representations or total variation) is still an active research area, since the associated optimization problems are quite challenging. In this paper, we propose an approach to deconvolving Poissonian images, which is based on an alternating direction optimization method. The standard regularization (or maximum a posteriori) restoration criterion, which combines the Poisson log-likelihood with a (non-smooth) convex regularizer (log-prior), leads to hard optimization problems: the log-likelihood is non-quadratic and non-separable, the regularizer is non-smooth, and there is a non-negativity constraint. Using standard convex analysis tools, we present sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of these optimization problems, for several types of regularizers: total-variation, frame-based analysis, and frame-based synthesis. We attack these problems with an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which belongs to the family of augmented Lagrangian algorithms.

Our aim is to construct knot homologies categorifying Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of knots for arbitrary representations, which will be done in a follow-up paper. We consider an algebraic construction of these categories, via an explicit diagrammatic presentation, generalizing the cyclotomic quotient of the quiver Hecke algebra. One of our primary results is that these categories coincide when both are defined. We also investigate finer structure of these categories. Like many similar representation-theoretic categories, they are standardly stratified and satisfy a double centralizer property with respect to their self-dual modules. The standard modules of the stratification play an important role, as Vermas do in more classical representation theory, as test objects for functors. The existence of these representations has consequences for the structure of previously studied categorifications; it allows us to prove the non-degeneracy of Khovanov and Lauda's 2-category (that its Hom spaces have the expected dimension) in all symmetrizable types, and that the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras are symmetric Frobenius.", "subjects": "Geometric Topology (math.GT)", "authors": "Ben Webster,", "date": "2010-1-13"},

In this paper, we present an algebraic representation of collisions which allows us to view each collision as a linear combination of the original packets. The transmitted, colliding packets may themselves be a coded version of the original packets. We propose a new acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism for collisions based on the idea that if a set of packets collide, the receiver can afford to ACK exactly one of them and still decode all the packets eventually. We analytically compare delay and throughput performance of such collision recovery schemes with other collision avoidance approaches in the context of a single hop wireless erasure network. In the multiple receiver case, the broadcast constraint calls for combining collision recovery methods with network coding across packets at the sender. From the delay perspective, our scheme, without any coordination, outperforms not only a ALOHA-type random access mechanisms, but also centralized scheduling. For the case of streaming arrivals, we propose a priority-based ACK mechanism and show that its stability region coincides with the cut-set bound of the packet erasure network.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Ali ParandehGheibi, Jay Kumar Sundararajan, Muriel Medard,", "date": "2010-1-12"},

Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed to date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of convolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism which explains why \"convolutional-like\" or \"spatially coupled\" codes perform so well. In essence, the spatial coupling of the individual code structure has the effect of increasing the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble to its maximum possible value, namely the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. For this reason we call this phenomenon \"threshold saturation.\" This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One significant advantage of such a construction is that one can create capacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius which is increasing in the blocklength. Our proof makes use of the area theorem of the BP-EXIT curve and the connection between the MAP and BP threshold recently pointed out by Measson, Montanari, Richardson, and Urbanke. Although we prove the connection between the MAP and the BP threshold only for a very specific ensemble and only for the binary erasure channel, empirically a threshold saturation phenomenon occurs for a wide class of ensembles and channels. More generally, we conjecture that for a large range of graphical systems a similar saturation of the \"dynamical\" threshold occurs once individual components are coupled sufficiently strongly.

The focus of this paper is its dynamic (stochastic) version, the Glauber dynamics, introduced in 1963 and by now the most popular means of sampling the Ising measure. Intensive study throughout the last three decades has yielded a rigorous understanding of the spectral-gap of the dynamics on everywhere except at criticality. While the critical behavior of the Ising model has long been the focus for physicists, mathematicians have only recently developed an understanding of its critical geometry with the advent of SLE, CLE and new tools to study conformally invariant systems. A rich interplay exists between the static and dynamic models. At the static phase-transition for Ising, the dynamics is conjectured to undergo a critical slowdown: At high temperature the inverse-gap is O(1), at the critical it is polynomial in the side-length and at low temperature it is exponential in it. A seminal series of papers verified this on except at where the behavior remained a challenging open problem. Here we establish the first rigorous polynomial upper bound for the critical mixing, thus confirming the critical slowdown for the Ising model in . Namely, we show that on a finite box with arbitrary (e.g. fixed, free, periodic) boundary conditions, the inverse-gap at is polynomial in the side-length.

We propose novel soft decision decoders for the orthogonal complex MIMO codes on three and four Tx antennas and extend the old result of maximal ratio combining (MRC) to cover all orthogonal codes up to four Tx antennas. As a rule, a sophisticated transmission scheme encompasses forward error correction (FEC) coding, and its performance is measured at the FEC decoder instead of at the MIMO decoder. We introduce the receiver structure that delivers the MIMO decoder's soft decisions to the demodulator, which in turn cranks out the logarithm of likelihood ratio (LLR) of each bit and delivers them to the FEC decoder. This makes a significant improvement on the receiver, where a maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO decoder makes hard decisions at a too early stage.

This motivates the definition of a hierarchy of five compatibility and comeasurability levels in the abstract setting of the quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. Their meanings are: the absence of quantum interference or influence, the existence of a joint distribution, simultaneous measurability, and the independence of the final state after two successive measurements from the sequential order of these two measurements. A further level means that two elements of the quantum logic (events) belong to the same Boolean subalgebra.

Specifically, only 1-bit feedback per fading block per user is available at the base station. We first study the ergodic sum-rate of the 1-bit feedback scheme, and consider the impact of feedback delay on the system. A closed-form expression for the achievable ergodic sum-rate is presented as a function of the fading temporal correlation coefficient. It is proved that the sum-rate scales as loglogK, which is the same scaling law achieved by the optimal non-delayed full CSI feedback scheme. The sum-rate degradation due to outdated CSI is also evaluated in the asymptotic regimes of either large K or low SNR. The outage performance of the 1-bit feedback scheme for both instantaneous and outdated feedback is then investigated. Expressions for the outage probabilities are derived, along with the corresponding diversity-multiplexing tradeoffs (DMT). It is shown that with instantaneous feedback, a power allocation based on the feedback bits enables to double the DMT compared to the case with short-term power constraint in which a dynamic power allocation is not allowed. But, with outdated feedback, the advantage of power allocation is lost, and the DMT reverts to that achievable with no CSI feedback.

In the first part of the paper, we develop a weak-* convergence framework for nonlinear operators, whose Gateaux derivatives are locally Lipschitz and satisfy a local inf-sup condition. The framework can be viewed as extending the recent convergence results for linear problems of Morin, Siebert and Veeser to a general nonlinear setting. We formulate an abstract adaptive approximation algorithm for nonlinear operator equations in Banach spaces with local structure. The weak-* convergence framework is then applied to this class of abstract locally adaptive algorithms, giving a general convergence result. The convergence result is then applied to a standard AFEM algorithm in the case of several semilinear and quasi-linear scalar elliptic equations and elliptic systems, including: a semilinear problem with subcritical nonlinearity, the steady Navier-Stokes equations, and a quasilinear problem with nonlinear diffusion. This yields several new AFEM convergence results for these nonlinear problems. In the second part of the paper we develop a second abstract convergence framework based on strong contraction, extending the recent contraction results for linear problems of Cascon, Kreuzer, Nochetto, and Siebert and of Mekchay and Nochetto to abstract nonlinear problems.

The main approach to deciding the feasibility of network coding problems aims to reduce the problem to optimization over a polytope of entropic vectors subject to constraints imposed by the network structure. In the case of directed acyclic graphs, these constraints are completely understood, but for general graphs the problem of enumerating them remains open: it is not known how to classify the constraints implied by a property that we call serializability, which refers to the absence of paradoxical circular dependencies in a network code. In this work we initiate the first systematic study of the constraints imposed on a network code by serializability. We find that serializability cannot be detected solely by evaluating the Shannon entropy of edge sets in the graph, but nevertheless, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that decides the serializability of a network code. We define a certificate of non-serializability, called an information vortex, that plays a role in the theory of serializability comparable to the role of fractional cuts in multicommodity flow theory, including a type of min-max relation. Finally, we study the serializability deficit of a network code, defined as the minimum number of extra bits that must be sent in order to make it serializable.

Our primary focus here is on BPX-style additive and multiplicative multilevel preconditioners, and on various stabilizations of the additive and multiplicative hierarchical basis method (HB), and their use in the local mesh refinement setting. In this article, we describe in detail the implementation of these types of algorithms, including detailed discussions of the datastructures and traversal algorithms we employ for obtaining optimal storage and computational complexity in our implementations. We show how each of the algorithms can be implemented using standard datatypes available in languages such as C and FORTRAN, so that the resulting algorithms have optimal (linear) storage requirements, and so that the resulting multilevel method or preconditioner can be applied with optimal (linear) computational costs.

In the analysis of WHB methods, a critical first step is to establish the optimality of BPX norm equivalence for the refinement procedures under consideration. While the available optimality results for the BPX norm have been constructed primarily in the setting of uniformly refined meshes, a notable exception is the local 2D red-green result due to Dahmen and Kunoth. The purpose of this article is to extend this original 2D optimality result to the local 3D red-green refinement procedure introduced by Bornemann-Erdmann-Kornhuber (BEK), and then to use this result to extend the WHB optimality results from the quasiuniform setting to local 2D and 3D red-green refinement scenarios. The BPX extension is reduced to establishing that locally enriched finite element subspaces allow for the construction of a scaled basis which is formally Riesz stable. It is possible to show that the number of degrees of freedom used for smoothing is bounded by a constant times the number of degrees of freedom introduced at that level of refinement, indicating that a practical implementable version of the resulting BPX preconditioner for the BEK refinement setting has provably optimal (linear) computational complexity per iteration.

This is modified in classical non-linear electrodynamic theories. To date there has been little experimental evidence that any of these modified theories are tenable. However with the advent of high-intensity lasers and powerful laboratory magnetic fields this situation may be changing. We argue that an approach involving the self-consistent relativistic motion of a smooth fluid-like distribution of matter (composed of a large number of charged or neutral particles) in an electromagnetic field offers a viable theoretical framework in which to explore the experimental consequences of non-linear electrodynamics. We construct such a model based on the theory of Born and Infeld and suggest that a simple laboratory experiment involving the propagation of light in a static magnetic field could be used to place bounds on the fundamental coupling in that theory.

Steady progress has shown that these CFTs should be logarithmic, with indecomposable operator product expansions, and indecomposable representations of the Virasoro algebra. In one of the earliest papers on the subject, V. Gurarie introduced a single parameter b to quantify this indecomposability in terms of the logarithmic partner t of the stress energy tensor T. He and A. Ludwig conjectured further that b=-5/8 for polymers and b=5/6 for percolation. While a lot of physics may be hidden behind this parameter - which has also given rise to a lot of discussions - it had remained very elusive up to now, due to the lack of available methods to measure it experimentally or numerically, in contrast say with the central charge. We show in this paper how to overcome the many difficulties in trying to measure b. This requires control of a lattice scalar product, lattice Jordan cells, together with a precise construction of the state L_|0&gt;. The final result is that b=5/6 for polymers. For percolation, we find that b=-5/8 within an XXZ or supersymmetric representation. In the geometrical representation, we do not find a Jordan cell for L_0 at level two (finite-size Hamiltonian and transfer matrices are fully diagonalizable), so there is no b in this case.", "subjects": "Mathematical Physics (math-ph)", "authors": "Jerome Dubail, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Hubert Saleur,", "date": "2010-1-7"},

A widely accepted method to circumvent this problem consists in replacing cpu time expensive computer models by cpu inexpensive mathematical functions, called metamodels. In this paper, we focus on the Gaussian process metamodel and two essential steps of its definition phase. First, the initial design of the computer code input variables (which allows to fit the metamodel) has to honor adequate space filling properties. We adopt a numerical approach to compare the performance of different types of space filling designs, in the class of the optimal Latin hypercube samples, in terms of the predictivity of the subsequent fitted metamodel. We conclude that such samples with minimal wrap-around discrepancy are particularly well-suited for the Gaussian process metamodel fitting. Second, the metamodel validation process consists in evaluating the metamodel predictivity with respect to the initial computer code. We propose and test an algorithm which optimizes the distance between the validation points and the metamodel learning points in order to estimate the true metamodel predictivity with a minimum number of validation points.

We refine this upper bound, and show that the resulting bound is sharp and explicitly computable in random graphs.

However, our new bound implies that the cover time for the critical Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,1/n) has order n, and shows how the cover time evolves from the critical window to the supercritical phase. Our general estimate also yields the order of the cover time for a variety of other concrete graphs, including critical percolation clusters on the Hamming hypercube ^n, on high-girth expanders, and on tori Z_n^d for fixed large d.

We use this quantum mechanical interpretation to give a new quantum algorithm for computing the Jones polynomial. This algorithm is useful for its conceptual simplicity, and it applies to all values of the polynomial variable that lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. Letting C(K) denote the Hilbert space for this model, there is a natural unitary transformation U from C(K) to itself such that &lt;K&gt; = &lt;F|U|F&gt; where |F&gt; is a sum over basis states for C(K). The quantum algorithm arises directly from this formula via the Hadamard Test. We then show that the framework for our quantum model for the bracket polynomial is a natural setting for Khovanov homology. The Hilbert space C(K) of our model has basis in one-to-one correspondence with the enhanced states of the bracket state summmation and is isomorphic with the chain complex for Khovanov homology with coefficients in the complex numbers. We show that for the Khovanov boundary operator d defined on C(K) we have the relationship dU + Ud = 0. Consequently, the unitary operator U acts on the Khovanov homology, and we therefore obtain a direct relationship between Khovanov homology and this quantum algorithm for the Jones polynomial. The formula for the Jones polynomial as a graded Euler characteristic is now expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of U and the Euler characteristics of the eigenspaces of U in the homology.

To circumvent this cumbersome and somewhat expensive step, we instead propose a simple PML formulation directly for the wave equation in its second-order form. Inside the absorbing layer, our formulation requires only two auxiliary variables in two space dimensions and four auxiliary variables in three space dimensions; hence it is cheap to implement. Since our formulation requires no higher derivatives, it is also easily coupled with standard finite difference or finite element methods.

For example, order barriers for stable LMF and the problem of order reduction for RK methods. Nevertheless, these goals are usually achieved at the price of a higher computational cost. Consequently, many efforts have been made in order to derive GLMs with particular features, to be exploited for their efficient implementation. In recent years, the derivation of GLMs from particular Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), namely the family of Generalized BDF (GBDF), has been proposed for the numerical solution of stiff ODE-IVPs. In particular, this approach has been recently developed, resulting in a new family of L-stable GLMs of arbitrarily high order, whose theory is here completed and fully worked-out.

A moderation incentive is identically zero on the boundary of the admissible control region and non-negative on the interior; it is bounded above by the infimum of the state-dependent cost function, so that the instantaneous total cost is always non-negative. The conservation law determined by the Maximum Principle, in combination with the condition that the moderation incentive equal zero on the boundary of the admissible control region, plays a crucial role in the analysis; in some situations, the initial and final values of the auxiliary variable are uniquely determined by the condition that the conserved quantity equal zero along a solution of the arbitrary duration synthesis problem. Use of an alternate system of evolution equations, parametrized by the auxiliary variable, for one-degree of freedom controlled acceleration systems, can significantly simplify numerical searches for solutions of the arbitrary duration synthesis problem. A one-parameter family of 'elliptical' moderation incentives is introduced; the behavior of the well-known quadratic control cost and its incentive analog is compared to that of the elliptical incentives in two simple controlled acceleration examples. The elliptical incentives yield smooth solutions with controls remaining in the interior of the admissible region, while the quadratic incentive allows piecewise smooth solutions with controls moving on and off the boundary of the admissible region; in these examples, the arbitrary duration synthesis problem for the traditional quadratic control cost has no solution; the total cost is a monotonically decreasing function of the duration.", "subjects": "Optimization and Control (math.OC)", "authors": "Debra Lewis,", "date": "2010-1-1"},

The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for Alice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in terms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security is measured in terms of Eve's equivocation ratio. Wyner showed that the situation is characterized by a single constant C_s, called the secrecy capacity, which has the following meaning: for all , there exist coding schemes of rate that asymptotically achieve both the reliability and the security objectives. However, his proof of this result is based upon a nonconstructive random-coding argument. To date, despite a considerable research effort, the only case where we know how to construct coding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when Eve's channel C_2 is an erasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof. Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and decoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme that achieves the secrecy capacity for a wide range of wiretap channels. Our construction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as long as both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and binary-input, and C_2 is degraded with respect to C_1. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to provide strong security, in the sense defined by Maurer, while still operating at a rate that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot guarantee that the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main channel C_1 is noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in practice.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Hessam Mahdavifar, Alexander Vardy,", "date": "2010-1-1"},

It is well known that Lasso can estimate the nonparametric regression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve upon. We show that the OLS post-Lasso estimator performs at least as well as Lasso in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller bias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the Lasso-based model selection \"fails\" in the sense of missing some components of the \"true\" regression model. By the \"true\" model, we mean the best s-dimensional approximation to the nonparametric regression function chosen by the oracle. Furthermore, OLS post-Lasso estimator can perform strictly better than Lasso, in the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the Lasso-based model selection correctly includes all components of the \"true\" model as a subset and also achieves sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when Lasso perfectly selects the \"true\" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on the dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the \"true\" model. Our rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso estimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other estimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and good sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and a new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit. The latter scheme has theoretical guarantees similar to those of Lasso or OLS post-Lasso, but it dominates those procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide variety of experiments.", "subjects": "Statistics Theory (math.ST)", "authors": "Alexandre Belloni, Victor Chernozhukov,", "date": "2015-01-01"},

The case relevant to classical string theory is when n=2 and is called \"2-plectic geometry\". Just as the Poisson bracket makes the smooth functions on a symplectic manifold into a Lie algebra, there is a Lie 2-algebra of observables associated to any 2-plectic manifold. String theory, closed 3-forms and Lie 2-algebras also play important roles in the theory of Courant algebroids. Courant algebroids are vector bundles which generalize the structures found in tangent bundles and quadratic Lie algebras. It is known that a particular kind of Courant algebroid (called an exact Courant algebroid) naturally arises in string theory, and that such an algebroid is classified up to isomorphism by a closed 3-form on the base space, which then induces a Lie 2-algebra structure on the space of global sections. In this paper we begin to establish precise connections between 2-plectic manifolds and Courant algebroids.

In this paper, we model different types of random network communications as the transmission of flats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us to introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding (RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously proposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we first evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in the error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and throughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of partial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC outperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more efficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible alterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which generalizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus reduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct metrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of codes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in particular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on rank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm.

Since both pure gravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially symmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum descriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is successfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin and Nicolai, Nucl.Phys.B475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum gravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S) -type models are obtained. We found that the F-S-like model is best suited for description of electroweak interactions while strong interactions require extension of Witten's results to the SU(3) gauge group. Such an extension is nontrivial. It is linked with the symmetry group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) of the Standard Model. This result is quite rigid and should be taken into account in development of all grand unified theories. Also, the alternative (to the F-S-like) model emerges as by-product of such an extension. Both models are related to each other via known symmetry transformation. Both models possess gap in their excitation spectrum and are capable of producing knotted/linked configurations of gauge/gravity fields. In addition, the paper discusses relevance of the obtained results to heterotic strings and to scattering processes involving topology change. It ends with discussion about usefulness of this information for searches of Higgs boson.", "subjects": "High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)", "authors": "Arkady L.Kholodenko,", "date": "2015-01-01"},

It is still wide open and regarded as one of the main open problems in finite model theory and database theory. Partial results have been obtained for specific classes of structures. In particular, it is known that fixed-point logic with counting captures polynomial time on all classes of graphs with excluded minors. The introductory part of this paper is a short survey of the state-of-the-art in the quest for a logic capturing polynomial time. The main part of the paper is concerned with classes of graphs defined by excluding induced subgraphs. Two of the most fundamental such classes are the class of chordal graphs and the class of line graphs. We prove that capturing polynomial time on either of these classes is as hard as capturing it on the class of all graphs. In particular, this implies that fixed-point logic with counting does not capture polynomial time on these classes. Then we prove that fixed-point logic with counting does capture polynomial time on the class of all graphs that are both chordal and line graphs.", "subjects": "Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)", "authors": "Martin Grohe,", "date": "2010-1-14"},

Here we present a practical method, grounded in the information-theoretic analysis of prediction, for inferring a minimal representation of that structure and for characterizing its complexity. Starting from spike trains, our approach finds their causal state models (CSMs), the minimal hidden Markov models or stochastic automata capable of generating statistically identical time series. We then use these CSMs to objectively quantify both the generalizable structure and the idiosyncratic randomness of the spike train. Specifically, we show that the expected algorithmic information content (the information needed to describe the spike train exactly) can be split into three parts describing (1) the time-invariant structure (complexity) of the minimal spike-generating process, which describes the spike train statistically; (2) the randomness (internal entropy rate) of the minimal spike-generating process; and (3) a residual pure noise term not described by the minimal spike-generating process. We use CSMs to approximate each of these quantities. The CSMs are inferred nonparametrically from the data, making only mild regularity assumptions, via the causal state splitting reconstruction algorithm. The methods presented here complement more traditional spike train analyses by describing not only spiking probability and spike train entropy, but also the complexity of a spike train's structure.

The data are processed by an onboard pipeline, followed onground by a reversing step. This paper illustrates the LFI scientific onboard processing to fit the allowed datarate. This is a lossy process tuned by using a set of 5 parameters Naver, r1, r2, q, O for each of the 44 LFI detectors. The paper quantifies the level of distortion introduced by the onboard processing, EpsilonQ, as a function of these parameters. It describes the method of optimizing the onboard processing chain. The tuning procedure is based on a optimization algorithm applied to unprocessed and uncompressed raw data provided either by simulations, prelaunch tests or data taken from LFI operating in diagnostic mode. All the needed optimization steps are performed by an automated tool, OCA2, which ends with optimized parameters and produces a set of statistical indicators, among them the compression rate Cr and EpsilonQ. For Planck/LFI the requirements are Cr = 2.4 and EpsilonQ &lt;= 10% of the rms of the instrumental white noise. To speedup the process an analytical model is developed that is able to extract most of the relevant information on EpsilonQ and Cr as a function of the signal statistics and the processing parameters. This model will be of interest for the instrument data analysis. The method was applied during ground tests when the instrument was operating in conditions representative of flight.

We think of our 3-dimensional space as an elastic continuum and assume that material points of this continuum can experience no displacements, only rotations. This framework is a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material points of the space continuum are described mathematically by attaching to each geometric point an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases called the coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we choose the coframe and a density. We choose a particular potential energy which is conformally invariant and then incorporate time into our action in the standard Newtonian way, by subtracting kinetic energy.

Here, we show that the three-dimensional capacity region for entanglement-assisted transmission of classical and quantum information is tractable for the Hadamard class of channels. Examples of Hadamard channels include generalized dephasing channels, cloning channels, and the Unruh channel. The generalized dephasing channels and the cloning channels are natural processes that occur in quantum systems through the loss of quantum coherence or stimulated emission, respectively. The Unruh channel is a noisy process that occurs in relativistic quantum information theory as a result of the Unruh effect and bears a strong relationship to the cloning channels.

Each pool is then tested and defective items are identified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools required to identify at most defective items. Motivated by applications in network tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of group testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group testing problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a graph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any set of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated with a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to the special case of a complete graph on vertices. For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained, namely, that the number of tests required to identify defective items is substantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing problems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if T(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph , it is shown that with non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective items. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph , as well as expander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify defective items. Next, a specific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it is shown that non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify defective items.

In this paper, we consider the continuous limit of the Majumdar--Papapetrou--Hartle--Hawking solution modeling a space occupied by an extended distribution of extremely charged dust.

At first, based on the close relation of foliations and noncommutative C*-algebras we show that cyclic cohomology invariants characterize some small exotic R^4. Certain exotic smooth R^4's define a generalized embedding into a space which is K-theoretic equivalent to a noncommutative Banach algebra. Furthermore, we show that a factor III von Neumann algebra is naturally related with nonstandard smoothing of a small R^4 and conjecture that this factor is the unique hyperfinite factor III_1. We also show how an exotic smoothing of a small R^4 is related to the Drinfeld-Turaev (deformation) quantization of the Poisson algebra (X(S,SL(2,C),) of complex functions on the space of flat connections X(S,SL(2,C) over a surface S, and that the result of this quantization is the skein algebra (K_t(S),[,]) for the deformation parameter t=exp(h/4). This skein algebra is retrieved as a II_1 factor of horocycle flows which is Morita equivalent to the II_infty factor von Neumann algebra which in turn determines the unique factor III_1 as crossed product. Moreover, the structure of Casson handles determine the factor II_1 algebra too. Thus, the quantization of the Poisson algebra of closed circles in a leaf of the codimension 1 foliation of S^3 gives rise to the factor III_1 associated with exotic smoothness of R^4. Finally, the approach to quantization via exotic 4-smoothness is considered as a fundamental question in dimension 4 and compared with the topos approach to quantum theories.", "subjects": "High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)", "authors": "Torsten Asselmeyer-Maluga, Jerzy Krol,", "date": "2010-1-6"},

Furthermore, we shall deal with this problem in the realm of cosmological spacetimes by analyzing the Einstein equations in a semiclassical fashion. More precisely, we shall show that, at least on small intervals of time, solutions for this interacting system exist. This result will be achieved providing an iteration scheme and showing that the series, obtained starting from the massless solution, converges in the appropriate Banach space. The quantum states with good ultraviolet behavior (Hadamard property), used in order to obtain the backreaction, will be completely determined by their form on the initial surface if chosen to be lightlike. Furthermore, on small intervals of time, they do not influence the behavior of the exact solution. On large intervals of time the situation is more complicated but, if the spacetime is expanding, we shall show that the end-point of the evolution does not depend strongly on the quantum state, because, in this limit, the expectation values of the matter fields responsible for the backreaction do not depend on the particular homogeneous Hadamard state at all. Finally, we shall comment on the interpretation of the semiclassical Einstein equations for this kind of problems. Although the fluctuations of the expectation values of pointlike fields diverge, if the spacetime and the quantum state have a large spatial symmetry and if we consider the smeared fields on regions of large spatial volume, they tend to vanish.

Methods based on boundary integral equations are natural in this context, since they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in complicated geometries. In order to handle the quasi-periodic conditions which are imposed on the unit cell, the free-space Green's function is typically replaced by its quasi-periodic cousin. Unfortunately, the quasi-periodic Green's function diverges for families of parameter values that correspond to resonances of the empty unit cell. Here, we bypass this problem by means of a new integral representation that relies on the free-space Green's function alone, adding auxiliary layer potentials on the boundary of the unit cell itself. An important aspect of our method is that by carefully including a few neighboring images, the densities may be kept smooth and convergence rapid. This framework results in an integral equation of the second kind, avoids spurious resonances, and achieves spectral accuracy. Because of our image structure, inclusions which intersect the unit cell walls may be handled easily and automatically.

This tool has the potential of being used for operational purposes: indeed, the numerical code VOLNA is able to handle the complete life-cycle of a tsunami (generation, propagation and run-up along the coast). The algorithm works on unstructured triangular meshes and thus can be run in arbitrary complex domains. This paper contains the detailed description of the finite volume scheme implemented in the code. The numerical treatment of the wet/dry transition is explained. This point is crucial for accurate run-up/run-down computations. Most existing tsunami codes use semi-empirical techniques at this stage, which are not always sufficient for tsunami hazard mitigation. Indeed the decision to evacuate inhabitants is based on inundation maps which are produced with this type of numerical tools.

In the classical supergravity limit the answer for a large class of theories has been known for some time. However, in the full quantum theory the U-duality group is broken to a discrete subgroup and the question of U-duality orbits in this case is a nuanced matter. In the present work we address this issue in the context of N=8 supergravity in four, five and six dimensions. The purpose of this note is to present and clarify what is currently known about these discrete orbits while at the same time filling in some of the details not yet appearing in the literature. To this end we exploit the mathematical framework of integral Jordan algebras and Freudenthal triple systems. The charge vector of the dyonic black string in D=6 is SO(5,5;Z) related to a two-charge reduced canonical form uniquely specified by a set of two arithmetic U-duality invariants. Similarly, the black hole (string) charge vectors in D=5 are E_(Z) equivalent to a three-charge canonical form, again uniquely fixed by a set of three arithmetic U-duality invariants. The situation in four dimensions is less clear: while black holes preserving more than 1/8 of the supersymmetries may be fully classified by known arithmetic E_(Z) invariants, 1/8-BPS and non-BPS black holes yield increasingly subtle orbit structures, which remain to be properly understood. However, for the very special subclass of projective black holes a complete classification is known. All projective black holes are E_(Z) related to a four or five charge canonical form determined uniquely by the set of known arithmetic U-duality invariants. Moreover, E_(Z) acts transitively on the charge vectors of black holes with a given leading-order entropy.", "subjects": "High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)", "authors": "L. Borsten, D.

First, we consider the case where the cost of querying grows exponentially in the number of queries and the goal is to minimize the expected exponential cost. Then, we consider the case where the objects are partitioned into groups, and the objective is to identify only the group to which the object belongs. We derive algorithms to address these issues in a common, information-theoretic framework. In particular, we present an exact formula for the objective function in each case involving Shannon or Renyi entropy, and develop a greedy algorithm for minimizing it.

The advantages of this relaxed formulation are illustrated with various examples in shallow and deep waters, as well as arbitrary depths. Using subordinate constraints (e.g., irrotationality or free surface impermeability) in various combinations, several model equations are derived, some being well-known, other being new.

We formulate the general problem of signal inference in the presence of unknown parameters within the framework of information field theory. We develop a generic parameter uncertainty renormalized estimation (PURE) technique and address the problem of reconstructing Gaussian signals with unknown power-spectrum with five different approaches: (i) separate maximum-a-posteriori power spectrum measurement and subsequent reconstruction, (ii) maximum-a-posteriori power reconstruction with marginalized power-spectrum, (iii) maximizing the joint posterior of signal and spectrum, (iv) guessing the spectrum from the variance in the Wiener filter map, and (v) renormalization flow analysis of the field theoretical problem providing the PURE filter. In all cases, the reconstruction can be described or approximated as Wiener filter operations with assumed signal spectra derived from the data according to the same recipe, but with differing coefficients. All of these filters, except the renormalized one, exhibit a perception threshold in case of a Jeffreys prior for the unknown spectrum. Data modes, with variance below this threshold do not affect the signal reconstruction at all. Filter (iv) seems to be similar to the so called Karhune-Loeve and Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock estimators for galaxy power spectra used in cosmology, which therefore should also exhibit a marginal perception threshold if correctly implemented.

In this paper we expose the algebraic and graphical structure of the GHZ-state and the W-state, as well as a purely graphical distinction that characterises the behaviours of these states. In turn, this structure yields a compositional graphical model for expressing general multipartite states. We identify those states, named Frobenius states, which canonically induce an algebraic structure, namely the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra (CFA). We show that all SLOCC-maximal tripartite qubit states are locally equivalent to Frobenius states. Those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the GHZ-state induce special commutative Frobenius algebras, while those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the W-state induce what we call anti-special commutative Frobenius algebras. From the SLOCC-classification of tripartite qubit states follows a representation theorem for two dimensional CFAs. Together, a GHZ and a W Frobenius state form the primitives of a graphical calculus.

This paper is divided into two parts, which are closely related to each other. In the first part, we discuss the statistical mechanical model of crystal melting counting BPS states. Each of the BPS state contributing to the BPS index is in one-to-one correspondence with a configuration of a molten crystal, and the statistical partition function of the melting crystal gives the BPS partition function. We also show that smooth geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold emerges in the thermodynamic limit of the crystal. This suggests a remarkable interpretation that an atom in the crystal is a discretization of the classical geometry, giving an important clue as to the geometry at the Planck scale.In the second part we discuss the wall crossing phenomena. Wall crossing phenomena states that the BPS index depends on the value of the moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold, and jumps along real codimension one subspaces in the moduli space. We show that by using type IIA/M-theory duality, we can provide a simple and an intuitive derivation of the wall crossing phenomena, furthermore clarifying the connection with the topological string theory.

With Rayleigh fading and the SINR averaged over the duration of the packet transmission, both models lead to closed form expressions for the probability of successful transmission. We show an excellent matching of these results with simulations. Using our models we compare the performances of non-slotted Aloha to previously studied slotted Aloha. We observe that when the path loss is not very strong both models, when appropriately optimized, exhibit similar performance. For stronger path loss non-slotted Aloha performs worse than slotted Aloha, however when the path loss exponent is equal to 4 its density of successfully received packets is still 75% of that in the slotted scheme.

CS exploits the surprising fact that the information contained in a sparse signal can be preserved in a small number of compressive (or random) linear measurements of that signal. Strong theoretical guarantees have been established on the accuracy to which sparse or near-sparse signals can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Building upon recent results concerning the stable embeddings of manifolds within the measurement space, we establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal bounds in for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation from noisy compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for sparsity-based CS, we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the probabilistic setting.

We analyze the local delays in such a network, namely the number of times slots required for nodes to transmit a packet to their prescribed next-hop receivers. The analysis depends very much on the receiver scenario and on the variability of the fading. In most cases, each node has finite-mean geometric random delay and thus a positive next hop throughput. However, the spatial (or large population) averaging of these individual finite mean-delays leads to infinite values in several practical cases, including the Rayleigh fading and positive thermal noise case. In some cases it exhibits an interesting phase transition phenomenon where the spatial average is finite when certain model parameters are below a threshold and infinite above. We call this phenomenon, contention phase transition. We argue that the spatial average of the mean local delays is infinite primarily because of the outage logic, where one transmits full packets at time slots when the receiver is covered at the required SINR and where one wastes all the other time slots. This results in the \"RESTART\" mechanism, which in turn explains why we have infinite spatial average. Adaptive coding offers a nice way of breaking the outage/RESTART logic.

This leads to a transparent and meaningful surrogate for density defined in terms of the average value of the logarithms of the densities of the distributions of principal components for a given dimension. This density approximation is estimable readily from data. It accurately represents, in a monotone way, key features of small-ball approximations to density.

This generalizes the results in [DV02], proved under the assumption that K is a number field and q an algebraic number. The results also hold for a field K which is a finite extension of a purely transcendental extension k(q) of a perfect field k. If k is a number field and q is a parameter, one can either reduce the equation modulo a finite place of k or specialize the parameter q, or both. In particular for q=1, we obtain a differential equation defined over a number field or in positive characteristic. In S II, we consider two Galois groups attached to a q-difference module M over K(x): the generic Galois group Gal(M), in the sense of [Kat82]; if char K=0, the generic differential Galois group Gal^D(M), which is a Kolchin differential algebraic group. We deduce an arithmetic description of Gal(M) (resp. Gal^D(M)). In positive characteristic, we prove some devissage. There are many Galois theories for q-difference equations defined over fields such as C, the elliptic functions, or the differential closure of C.

The main difference to the traditional calibration of scan statistics is the concept of grouping scan windows according to their sizes, and then applying different critical values to different groups. It is shown that this calibration of the scan statistic results in optimal inference for spatial clusters on both small scales and on large scales, as well as in the case where the cluster lives on one of the marginals.

We consider a diversity scheme where only the sensor with the best channel sends their measurements over a fading channel to a fusion center, using the analog amplify and forwarding technique. The fusion centre reconstructs an MMSE estimate of the source based on the received measurements. A distributed version of the diversity scheme where sensors decide whether to transmit based only on their local channel information is also considered. We derive asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion (of the MMSE estimate at the fusion centre) of these schemes as the number of sensors becomes large. For comparison, asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion for a coherent multi-access scheme and an orthogonal access scheme are derived. We also study for the diversity schemes, the optimal power allocation for minimizing the expected distortion subject to average total power constraints. The effect of optimizing the probability of transmission on the expected distortion in the distributed scenario is also studied. It is seen that as opposed to the coherent multi-access scheme and the orthogonal scheme (where the expected distortion decays as 1/M, M being the number of sensors), the expected distortion decays only as 1/ln(M) for the diversity schemes. This reduction of the decay rate can be seen as a tradeoff between the simplicity of the diversity schemes and the strict synchronization and large bandwidth requirements for the coherent multi-access and the orthogonal schemes, respectively.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Alex S.

The replica method, developed in statistical mechanics, is used to evaluate the performance in the large-system limit, where the number of users and the spreading factor tend to infinity while their ratio and the number of transmit and receive antennas are kept constant. The performance of the joint CE-MUDD based on LMMSE channel estimation is compared to the spectral efficiencies of several receivers based on one-shot LMMSE channel estimation, in which the decoded data symbols are not utilized to refine the initial channel estimates.

The following results are reported: i) Cantor's proofs of nondenumerability are refuted by analyzing the logical inconsistencies in implementation of the reductio method of proof and by identifying errors. Particular attention is given to the diagonalization argument and to the interpretation of the axiom of infinity. ii) Three constructive proofs have been designed that support the denumerability of the power set of the natural numbers, P(N), thus implying the denumerability of the set of the real numbers R. These results lead to a Theorem of the Continuum that supersedes Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis and establishes the countable nature of the real number line, suggesting that all infinite sets are denumerable. Some immediate implications of denumerability are discussed: i) Valid proofs should not include inconceivable statements, defined as statements that can be found to be false and always lead to contradiction. This is formalized in a Principle of Conceivable Proof. ii) Substantial simplification of the axiomatic principles of set theory can be achieved by excluding transfinite numbers. To facilitate the comparison of sets, infinite as well as finite, the concept of relative cardinality is introduced. iii) Proofs of incompleteness that use diagonal arguments (e.g. those used in Godel's Theorems) are refuted. A constructive proof, based on the denumerability of P(N), is presented to demonstrate the existence of a theory of first-order arithmetic that is consistent, sound, negation-complete, decidable and (assumed p.r. adequate) able to prove its own consistency.

Natural criterion functions are often unavailable for general functional measurement error models due to the lack of information on the distribution of the unobservable covariates. Typically, the parameter estimation is via solving estimating equations. In addition, the construction of such estimating equations routinely requires solving integral equations, hence the computation is often much more intensive compared with ordinary regression models. Because of these difficulties, traditional best subset variable selection procedures are not applicable, and in the measurement error model context, variable selection remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we develop a framework for variable selection in measurement error models via penalized estimating equations. We first propose a class of selection procedures for general parametric measurement error models and for general semi-parametric measurement error models, and study the asymptotic properties of the proposed procedures. Then, under certain regularity conditions and with a properly chosen regularization parameter, we demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs as well as an oracle procedure.

Typically, the channel responses are estimated one-at-a-time: a single source sends out a known probe signal, the receiver measures the probe signal convolved with the channel response, and the responses are recovered using deconvolution. In this paper, we show that if the channel responses are sparse and the probe signals are random, then we can significantly reduce the total amount of time required to probe the channels by activating all of the sources simultaneously. With all sources activated simultaneously, the receiver measures a superposition of all the channel responses convolved with the respective probe signals. Separating this cumulative response into individual channel responses can be posed as a linear inverse problem. We show that channel response separation is possible (and stable) even when the probing signals are relatively short in spite of the corresponding linear system of equations becoming severely underdetermined. We derive a theoretical lower bound on the length of the source signals that guarantees that this separation is possible with high probability. The bound is derived by putting the problem in the context of finding a sparse solution to an underdetermined system of equations, and then using mathematical tools from the theory of compressive sensing.

In previous papers, in the homogeneous Poisson case, for the branching system in \"low\" dimensions, the limit was characterized by a long-range dependent Gaussian process called sub-fractional Brownian motion (sub-fBm), and this effect was attributed to the branching because it had appeared only in that case. An unexpected finding in this paper is that sub-fBm is more prevalent than previously thought. Namely, it is a natural ingredient of the limit process in the non-branching case (for \"low\" dimension), as well.

It is remarkable that Peano's strict derivative provides a consistent mathematical ground to the concept of \"infinitesimal ratio\" between two magnitudes, successfully used since Kepler. In this way the classical (i.e., pre-Lebesgue) measure theory reaches a complete and definitive form in Peano's Applicazioni geometriche. A primary aim of the present paper is a detailed exposition of Peano's work of 1887 leading to the concept of strict derivative of distributive set functions and their use. Moreover, we compare Peano's work and Lebesgue's \"La mesure des grandeurs\" (1935): in this memoir Lebesgue, motivated by coexistent magnitudes of Cauchy, introduces a uniform-derivative of certain additive set functions, a concept that coincides with Peano's strict derivative.

We formulate a generalized CMC for any kind of observations on which independence is defined via an arbitrary submodular information measure. Recently, this has been discussed for observations in terms of binary strings where information is understood in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity. Our approach enables us to find computable alternatives to Kolmogorov complexity, e.g., the length of a text after applying existing data compression schemes. We show that our CMC is justified if one restricts the attention to a class of causal mechanisms that is adapted to the respective information measure.

The cellular network is formed by base-stations (BSs) placed in a one, two or three dimensional space according to a possibly non-homogeneous Poisson point process, which is a generalization of the so-called shotgun cellular system. We develop a sequence of equivalence relations for the SCSs and use them to derive semi-analytical expressions for the coverage probability at the MS when the transmissions from each BS may be affected by random fading with arbitrary distributions as well as attenuation following arbitrary path-loss models. For homogeneous Poisson point processes in the interference-limited case with power-law path-loss model, we show that the SINR distribution is the same for all fading distributions and is not a function of the base station density. In addition, the influence of random transmission powers, power control, multiple channel reuse groups on the downlink performance are also discussed. The techniques developed for the analysis of SINR have applications beyond cellular networks and can be used in similar studies for cognitive radio networks, femtocell networks and other heterogeneous and multi-tier networks.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Prasanna Madhusudhanan, Juan G.

In this paper, we provide a closed form expression for a non pure-FS epsilon-Nash equilibrium point; i.e., an equilibrium point where players choose FDM for some channel realizations and FS for the others. We show that operating in this non pure-FS epsilon-Nash equilibrium point increases each user's throughput and therefore improves the spectrum utilization, and demonstrate that this performance gain can be substantial.

Shannon defined mathematically the amount of information transmitted over a channel. The amount of information doesn't mean the number of symbols of data. It depends on occurrence probabilities of symbols of the data. Meanwhile, psychophysics is the study of quantitative relations between psychological events and physical events or, more specifically, between sensations and the stimuli that produce them. It seems that Shannon's information theory bears no relation to psychophysics established by German scientist and philosopher Fechner. Here I show that to our astonishment it is possible to combine two fields.

The problem is studied from the viewpoint of complex oscillation theory first developed by Bank and Laine (1982, 1983) and Gundersen and Steinbart (1994). We show that when a solution is complex non-oscillatory (finite exponent of convergence of zeros) then the solution, which can be written as special functions, must degenerate. This gives a necessary and sufficient condition when the Lommel function has finitely many zeros in every branch and this is a type of quantization for the non-homogeneous differential equation. The degenerate solutions are of polynomial/rational-type functions which are of independent interest. In particular, this shows that complex non-oscillatory solutions of this class of differential equations are equivalent to the subnormal solutions considered in a previous paper of the authors (to appear).

This is made possible by a representation in terms of occupation numbers of two states: Active and refractory. The dynamics of these occupation numbers follows a distributed delay differential equation. In particular, our theory enables us to uncover the effect of refractoriness on the time-dependent rate of an ensemble of encoding point processes in response to modulation of the input. We present exact solutions that demonstrate generic features, such as stochastic transients and oscillations in the step response as well as resonances, phase jumps and frequency doubling in the transfer of periodic signals.

The link is established via weighted projective lines and (stable) categories of vector bundles on those. The setup yields a new approach to attack the subspace problem. In particular, we deduce the main results of Ringel and Schmidmeier for nilpotency degree p from properties of the category of vector bundles on the weighted projective line of weight type (2,3,p), obtained by Serre construction from the triangle singularity x^2+y^3+z^p. For p=6 the Ringel-Schmidmeier classification is thus covered by the classification of vector bundles for tubular type (2,3,6), and then is closely related to Atiyah's classification of vector bundles on a smooth elliptic curve. Returning to the general case, we establish that the stable categories associated to vector bundles or invariant subspaces of nilpotent operators may be naturally identified as triangulated categories. They satisfy Serre duality and also have tilting objects whose endomorphism rings play a role in singularity theory.

However, the modified coproduct on the subalgebra will no longer be an algebra map. So, in general we do not have an algebraic quantum group but a so-called algebraic quantum hypergroup.

The objective is to minimize the weighted sum download time (WSDT) for the one-to-many file transfer. Previous work has shown that, given an order at which the receivers finish downloading, the minimum WSD can be solved in polynomial time by convex optimization, and can be achieved by linear network coding, assuming that node uplinks are the only bottleneck in the network. This paper, however, considers heterogeneous peers with both uplink and downlink bandwidth constraints specified. The static scenario is a file-transfer scheme in which the network resource allocation remains static until all receivers finish downloading. This paper first shows that the static scenario may be optimized in polynomial time by convex optimization, and the associated optimal static WSD can be achieved by linear network coding. This paper then presented a lower bound to the minimum WSDT that is easily computed and turns out to be tight across a wide range of parameterizations of the problem. This paper also proposes a static routing-based scheme and a static rateless-coding-based scheme which have almost-optimal empirical performances.

We provide an analytic proof for the existence of two-soliton configurations with chaotic temporal behavior, and construct solutions which are closed to a grid of such chaotic soliton pairs, with every pair in the grid well spatially separated from the neighboring ones for all time. The temporal evolution of the well-separated multi-soliton structures is described by a weakly coupled lattice dynamical system (LDS) for the coordinates and phases of the solitons. We develop a version of normal hyperbolicity theory for the weakly coupled LDSs with continuous time and establish for them the existence of space-time chaotic patterns similar to the Sinai-Bunimovich chaos in discrete-time LDSs. While the LDS part of the theory may be of independent interest, the main difficulty addressed in the paper concerns with lifting the space-time chaotic solutions of the LDS back to the initial PDE. The equations we consider here are space-time autonomous, i.e. we impose no spatial or temporal modulation which could prevent the individual solitons in the grid from drifting towards each other and destroying the well-separated grid structure in a finite time.

We address the problem of opportunistic multiuser scheduling under imperfect channel state information, by exploiting the memory inherent in the channel. In our setting, the channel between the base station and each user is modeled by a two-state Markov chain and the scheduled user sends back an ARQ feedback signal that arrives at the scheduler with a random delay that is i.i.d across users and time. The scheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedback and uses this information to make scheduling decisions. We formulate a throughput maximization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). For the case of two users in the system, we show that a greedy policy is sum throughput optimal for any distribution on the ARQ feedback delay. For the case of more than two users, we prove that the greedy policy is suboptimal and demonstrate, via numerical studies, that it has near optimal performance. We show that the greedy policy can be implemented by a simple algorithm that does not require the statistics of the underlying Markov channel or the ARQ feedback delay, thus making it robust against errors in system parameter estimation. Establishing an equivalence between the two-user system and a genie-aided system, we obtain a simple closed form expression for the sum capacity of the Markov-modeled downlink. We further derive inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the Markov-modeled downlink and tighten these bounds for special cases of the system parameters.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Sugumar Murugesan, Philip Schniter, Ness B.

The related constructions were essentially based on the study of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of some specific Barabanov norms. In this context the situation when one fails to find among current publications any detailed analysis of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of Barabanov norms looks a bit paradoxical.

So, even in simplest cases it is very difficult to visualize the shape of their unit balls. The present work may be treated as the first step to make up this deficiency.

We first derive the capacity upper bound and the achievable rates with three existing schemes: Decode-and-Forward (DF), Compress-and-Forward (CF), and Amplify-and-Forward (AF). We present two capacity results under specific noise correlation coefficients, one being achieved by DF and the other being achieved by direct link transmission (or a special case of CF). The channel for the former capacity result is equivalent to the traditional Gaussian degraded relay channel and the latter corresponds to the Gaussian reversely-degraded relay channel. For CF and AF schemes, we show that their achievable rates are strictly decreasing functions over the negative correlation coefficient. Through numerical comparisons under different channel settings, we observe that although DF completely disregards the noise correlation while the other two can potentially exploit such extra information, none of the three relay schemes always outperforms the others over different correlation coefficients. Moreover, the exploitation of noise correlation by CF and AF accrues more benefit when the source-relay link is weak. This paper also considers the optimal power allocation problem under the correlated-noise channel setting. With individual power constraints at the relay and the source, it is shown that the relay should use all its available power to maximize the achievable rates under any correlation coefficient. With a total power constraint across the source and the relay, the achievable rates are proved to be concave functions over the power allocation factor for AF and CF under full-duplex mode, where the closed-form power allocation strategy is derived.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Lili Zhang, Jinhua Jiang, Andrea J.

For multi-source multicast networks, the scheme naturally extends both network coding over noiseless networks by Ahlswede, Cai, Li, and Yeung, and compress-forward coding for the relay channel by Cover and El Gamal to general discrete memoryless and Gaussian networks. The scheme also recovers as special cases the results on coding for wireless relay networks and deterministic networks by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse, and coding for wireless erasure networks by Dana, Gowaikar, Palanki, Hassibi, and Effros. The scheme involves message repetition coding, relay signal compression, and simultaneous decoding. Unlike previous compress--forward schemes, where independent messages are sent over multiple blocks, the same message is sent multiple times using independent codebooks as in the network coding scheme for cyclic networks. Furthermore, the relays do not use Wyner--Ziv binning as in previous compress-forward schemes, and each decoder performs simultaneous joint typicality decoding on the received signals from all the blocks without explicitly decoding the compression indices. A consequence of this new scheme is that achievability is proved simply and more generally without resorting to time expansion to extend results for acyclic networks to networks with cycles. The noisy network coding scheme is then extended to general multi-source networks by combining it with decoding techniques for interference channels. For the Gaussian multicast network, noisy network coding improves the previously established gap to the cutset bound. We also demonstrate through two popular AWGN network examples that noisy network coding can outperform conventional compress-forward, amplify-forward, and hash-forward schemes.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Sung Hoon Lim, Young-Han Kim, Abbas El Gamal, Sae-Young Chung,", "date": "2010-2-16"},

Here we propose another alternative, which may be viewed as a hybrid of nudging and IAU and which arises naturally from a recently proposed continuous formulation of the ensemble Kalman analysis step.

In contrast to existing cellular systems, femtocells are end-user deployed and controlled, randomly located, and rely on third party backhaul (e.g. DSL or cable modem). Femtocells can be configured to be either open access or closed access. Open access allows an arbitrary nearby cellular user to use the femtocell, whereas closed access restricts the use of the femtocell to users explicitly approved by the owner. Seemingly, the network operator would prefer an open access deployment since this provides an inexpensive way to expand their network capabilities, whereas the femtocell owner would prefer closed access, in order to keep the femtocell's capacity and backhaul to himself. We show mathematically and through simulations that the reality is more complicated for both parties, and that the best approach depends heavily on whether the multiple access scheme is orthogonal (TDMA or OFDMA, per subband) or non-orthogonal (CDMA). In a TDMA/OFDMA network, closed-access is typically preferable at high user densities, whereas in CDMA, open access can provide gains of more than 200% for the home user by reducing the near-far problem experienced by the femtocell. The results of this paper suggest that the interests of the femtocell owner and the network operator are more compatible than typically believed, and that CDMA femtocells should be configured for open access whereas OFDMA or TDMA femtocells should adapt to the cellular user density.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Ping Xia, Vikram Chandrasekhar, Jeffrey G.

A PCD is a random directed graph (i.e., digraph) which is constructed from data using the relative positions of the points from various classes. Different PCDs result from different definitions of the proximity region associated with each data point. We consider the underlying and reflexivity graphs based on a family of PCDs which is determined by a family of parameterized proximity maps called proportional-edge (PE) proximity map. The graph invariant we investigate is the relative edge density of the underlying and reflexivity graphs. We demonstrate that, properly scaled, relative edge density of these graphs is a -statistic, and hence obtain the asymptotic normality of the relative edge density for data from any distribution that satisfies mild regulatory conditions. By detailed probabilistic and geometric calculations, we compute the explicit form of the asymptotic normal distribution for uniform data on a bounded region in the usual Euclidean plane.

Comp. Phys. 2009 for approximating the spectral function of composites from effective properties at different frequencies. The spectral functions contain microstructure information. Since this reconstruction problem is ill-posed [9], the well-performed Pade approach is noteworthy and requires further investigations. In this paper, we validate the assumption that the effective dielectric component of interest can be approximated by Pade approximants whose denominator has nonzero power one term. We refer to this as the nonstandard Pade approximant, in contrast to the standard approximants with nonzero constant terms. For composites whose spectral function assumes infinitely many different values, the proof is carried by using classic results for Stieltjes functions. For those with spectral functions having only finitely many different values, we prove the results by utilizing a special product decomposition of the coefficient matrix of the Pade system. The results in this paper can be considered as an extension of the Pade theory for Stieltjes functions whose spectral function take infinitely many different values to those taking only finitely many values. In the literature, the latter is usually excluded from the definition of Stieltjes functions because they correspond to rational functions, hence convergence of their Pade approximants is trivial. However, from an inverse problem point of view, our main concern is the existence of the nonstandard Pade approximants, rather than their convergence.

The method is inverse optimal because the running cost that renders the control input optimal is also explicitly determined. One special feature of this work, as compared to other methods in the literature, is the fact that the solution is obtained directly for the control input. The value function can also be obtained after one solves for the control input. Furthermore, a Lyapunov function that proves at least local stability of the controller is also obtained. In this regard the main contribution of this paper can be interpreted in two different ways: offering an analytical expression for Lyapunov functions for a class of nonlinear systems and obtaining an optimal controller for the same class of systems using a specific optimization functional. We also believe that an additional contribution of this paper is to identify explicit classes of systems and optimization functionals for which optimal control problems can be solved analytically. In particular, for second order systems three cases are identified: i) control input only as a function of the second state variable, ii) control input affine in the second state variable when the dynamics are affine in that variable and iii) control input affine in the first state variable when the dyamics are affine in that variable.

This cross-layer algorithm jointly performs medium access control (MAC) and physical-layer rate adaptation. The paper establishes that this algorithm is throughput-optimal for general rate regions. In contrast to on-off scheduling, rate allocation enables optimal utilization of physical-layer schemes by scheduling multiple rate levels. The algorithm is based on local queue-length information, and thus the algorithm is of significant practical value. The algorithm requires that each link can determine the global feasibility of increasing its current data-rate. In many classes of networks, any one link's data-rate primarily impacts its neighbors and this impact decays with distance. Hence, local exchanges can provide the information needed to determine feasibility. Along these lines, the paper discusses the potential use of existing physical-layer control messages to determine feasibility. This can be considered as a technique analogous to carrier sensing in CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) networks. An important application of this algorithm is in multiple-band multiple-radio throughput-optimal distributed scheduling for white-space networks.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Jubin Jose, Sriram Vishwanath,", "date": "2010-2-15"},

Given information about what does not constitute a solution, closed choice determines a solution. We show that with closed choice one can characterize several models of hypercomputation in a uniform framework using Weihrauch reducibility. The classes of functions which are reducible to closed choice of the singleton space, of the natural numbers, of Cantor space and of Baire space correspond to the class of computable functions, of functions computable with finitely many mind changes, of weakly computable functions and of effectively Borel measurable functions, respectively. We also prove that all these classes correspond to classes of non-deterministically computable functions with the respective spaces as advice spaces. Moreover, we prove that closed choice on Euclidean space can be considered as \"locally compact choice\" and it is obtained as product of closed choice on the natural numbers and on Cantor space. We also prove a Quotient Theorem for compact choice which shows that single-valued functions can be \"divided\" by compact choice in a certain sense. Another result is the Independent Choice Theorem, which provides a uniform proof that many choice principles are closed under composition. Finally, we also study the related class of low computable functions, which contains the class of weakly computable functions as well as the class of functions computable with finitely many mind changes. As one main result we prove a uniform version of the Low Basis Theorem that states that closed choice on Cantor space (and the Euclidean space) is low computable.

Thus, words that permute a given subset are uniquely factorizable as products of the subset's minimal permutators, and these can be further reduced to straight minimal permutators.

We find that the Bogolyubov-Valatin group for n=2 fermionic modes which can be implemented by means of unitary SU(2^n = 4) transformations is isomorphic to SO(6;R)/Z_2. The investigation touches on a number of subjects. As a novelty from a mathematical point of view, we study the structure of nonlinear basis transformations in a Clifford algebra [specifically, in the Clifford algebra C(0,4)] entailing (supersymmetric) transformations among multivectors of different grades. A prominent algebraic role in this context is being played by biparavectors (linear combinations of products of Dirac matrices, quadriquaternions, sedenions) and spin bivectors (antisymmetric complex matrices). The studied biparavectors are equivalent to Eddington's E-numbers and can be understood in terms of the tensor product of two commuting copies of the division algebra of quaternions H. From a physical point of view, we present a method to diagonalize any arbitrary two-fermion Hamiltonian.

However, only very few construction strategies for discrete shearlet systems are known so far. In this paper, we take a geometric approach to this problem. Utilizing the close connection with group representations, we first introduce and analyze an upper and lower weighted shearlet density based on the shearlet group. We then apply this geometric measure to provide necessary conditions on the geometry of the sets of parameters for the associated shearlet systems to form a frame for L^2( R^2), either when using all possible generators or a large class exhibiting some decay conditions. While introducing such a feasible class of shearlet generators, we analyze approximation properties of the associated shearlet systems, which themselves lead to interesting insights into homogeneous approximation abilities of shearlet frames. We also present examples, such a oversampled shearlet systems and co-shearlet systems, to illustrate the usefulness of our geometric approach to the construction of shearlet frames.", "subjects": "Functional Analysis (math.FA)", "authors": "P.

Specially, these include (i) identical packets must be delivered successfully to several nodes, (ii) outage at any receiver requires the packet to be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and (iii) the multicast rate is dominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and retransmission. A first contribution of this paper is the development of a tractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these key traits in a multicast wireless network. We utilize a Poisson cluster process (PCP) consisting of a distinct Poisson point process (PPP) for the transmitters and receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (MTC) as the maximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximum intensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outage constraints. A multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet is multicasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into smaller regions of multicast. The second contribution of the paper is the analysis of several key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following main result. Assuming transmission attempts are allowed for each tessellated region in a multicast cluster, we show that the MTC is where , and are functions of and depending on the network size and intensity, and is the average number of the intended receivers in a cluster. We derive for a number of regimes of interest, and also show that an appropriate number of retransmissions can significantly enhance the MTC.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Chun-Hung Liu, Jeffrey G.

Such a system of equations is similar to compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a barotropic fluid with a non-constant viscosity. To do that, we consider a layer of incompressible and Newtonian fluid which is relatively thin, assuming no surface tension at the free surface. The motion of the fluid is described by 3d Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity and free surface. We prove that for a set of suitable initial data (asymptotically close to ?shallow water initial data?), the Cauchy problem for these equations is well-posed, and the solution converges to the solution of viscous shallow water equations. More precisely, we build the solution of the full problem as a perturbation of the strong solution to the viscous shallow water equations. The method of proof is based on a Lagrangian change of variable that fixes the fluid domain and we have to prove the well-posedness in thin domains: we have to pay a special attention to constants in classical Sobolev inequalities and regularity in Stokes problem.", "subjects": "Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)", "authors": "Didier Bresch, Pascal Noble,", "date": "2010-2-12"},

In this model, the velocity field is a two-dimensional perturbation of a linear straining flow with axial symmetry. The only free parameter is the Reynolds number , where is the total circulation of the vortex and is the kinematic viscosity. The purpose of this paper is to show that Burgers vortex is asymptotically stable with respect to general three-dimensional perturbations, for all values of the Reynolds number. This definitive result subsumes earlier studies by various authors, which were either restricted to small Reynolds numbers or to two-dimensional perturbations. Our proof relies on the crucial observation that the linearized operator at Burgers vortex has a simple and very specific dependence upon the axial variable. This allows to reduce the full linearized equations to a vectorial two-dimensional problem, which can be treated using an extension of the techniques developped in earlier works. Although Burgers vortices are found to be stable for all Reynolds numbers, the proof indicates that perturbations may undergo an important transient amplification if is large, a phenomenon that was indeed observed in numerical simulations.", "subjects": "Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)", "authors": "Thierry Gallay, Yasunori Maekawa,", "date": "2010-2-12"},

It has been showed by X. Dai, D. R. Larson, and D. M. Speegle in [11] that for any real-valued expansive matrix M, a homogeneous orthonormal M-wavelet basis can be generated by a single wavelet function. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated in [21] that nonhomogeneous wavelet systems, though much less studied in the literature, play a fundamental role in wavelet analysis and naturally link many aspects of wavelet analysis together. In this paper, we are interested in nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in high dimensions with a minimum number of generators. As we shall see in this paper, a nonhomogeneous wavelet system naturally leads to a homogeneous wavelet system with almost all properties preserved. We also show that a nonredundant nonhomogeneous wavelet system is naturally connected to refinable structures and has a fixed number of wavelet generators. Consequently, it is often impossible for a nonhomogeneous orthonormal wavelet basis to have a single wavelet generator. However, for redundant nonhomogeneous wavelet systems, we show that for any real-valued expansive matrix M, we can always construct a nonhomogeneous smooth tight M-wavelet frame in with a single wavelet generator whose Fourier transform is a compactly supported function. Moreover, such nonhomogeneous tight wavelet frames are associated with filter banks and can be modified to achieve directionality in high dimensions. Our analysis of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems employs a notion of frequency-based nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in the distribution space.

The maximum achievable rate of channel training is close to the lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of subspace coding. Two coding approaches based on channel training are proposed and their performances are evaluated. Our first approach makes use of rank-metric codes and its optimality depends on the existence of maximum rank distance codes.

The scheme uses the Fourier transform to reduce the original BIE defined on a surface to a sequence of BIEs defined on a generating curve for the surface. It can handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally symmetric. Nystrom discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the generating curve. The quadrature used is a high-order Gaussian rule that is modified near the diagonal to retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels. The reduction in dimensionality, along with the use of high-order accurate quadratures, leads to small linear systems that can be inverted directly via, e.g., Gaussian elimination. This makes the scheme particularly fast in environments involving multiple right hand sides. It is demonstrated that for BIEs associated with Laplace's equation, the kernel in the reduced equations can be evaluated very rapidly by exploiting recursion relations for Legendre functions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the scheme; in particular, it is demonstrated that for a BIE associated with Laplace's equation on a surface discretized using 320 000 points, the set-up phase of the algorithm takes 2 minutes on a standard desktop, and then solves can be executed in 0.5 seconds.", "subjects": "Numerical Analysis (math.NA)", "authors": "Patrick M.

The evolution of a bidisperse mixture of particles can be modeled by a nonlinear first order partial differential equation, provided the shear (or velocity) is a known function of position. While avalanche-driven shear is approximately uniform in depth, boundary-driven shear typically creates a shear band with a nonlinear velocity profile. In this paper, we measure a velocity profile from experimental data and solve initial value problems that mimic the segregation observed in the experiment, thereby verifying the value of the continuum model. To simplify the analysis, we consider only one-dimensional configurations, in which a layer of small particles is placed above a layer of large particles within an annular shear cell and is sheared for arbitrarily long times. We fit the measured velocity profile to both an exponential function of depth and a piecewise linear function which separates the shear band from the rest of the material. Each solution of the initial value problem is non-standard, involving curved characteristics in the exponential case, and a material interface with a jump in characteristic speed in the piecewise linear case.", "subjects": "Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)", "authors": "Lindsay B.

We introduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE) which is the expected -distance between the strategy given by the algorithm and the optimal strategy, as a performance indicator for the two models. We study the behaviour of the MSE with respect to the number of scenarios used for discretization. The first model, widely studied in the Stochastic Programming community, consists in approximating the noise diffusion using a scenario tree representation. On a numerical example, we observe that the number of scenarios needed to obtain a given precision grows exponentially with the time horizon. In that sense, our conclusion on scenario trees is equivalent to the one in the work by Shapiro (2006) and has been widely noticed by practitioners. However, in the second part, we show using the same example that, by mixing Stochastic Programming and Dynamic Programming ideas, the particle method described by Carpentier et al (2009) copes with this numerical difficulty: the number of scenarios needed to obtain a given precision now does not depend on the time horizon.

While previous authors have minimized ropelength for polygons using simulated annealing, the new idea in our code is to minimize length over the set of polygons of thickness at least one using a version of constrained gradient descent. We rewrite the problem in terms of minimizing the length of the polygon subject to an infinite family of differentiable constraint functions. We prove that the polyhedral cone of variations of a polygon of thickness one which do not decrease thickness to first order is finitely generated, and give an explicit set of generators. Using this cone we give a first-order minimization procedure and a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker criterion for polygonal ropelength criticality.

Let H be a compact submanifold of M. In a previous article, the second-named author proved estimates on the L^p norms, p &gt; 2, of u restricted to H, under the assumption that the u are semiclassically localised and under some natural structural assumptions about the principal symbol of P. These estimates are of the form Ch^d(n;k;p) where k=dimH (except for a logarithmic divergence in the case k = n-2; p = 2). When H is a hypersurface, i.e. k = n-1, we have d(n;n-1;2)=1/4, which is sharp when M is the round n-sphere and H is an equator. In this article, we assume that H is a hypersurface, and make the additional geometric assumption that H is curved with respect to the bicharacteristic flow of P. Under this assumption we improve the estimate from d=1/4 to 1/6, generalising work of Burq-Gerard-Tzvetkov and Hu for Laplace eigenfunctions.

Next, Hermite polynomials in a full superspace with O(m) x Sp(2n) symmetry are considered. It is shown that they are not orthogonal with respect to the canonically defined inner product. However, a new inner product is introduced which behaves correctly with respect to the structure of harmonic polynomials on superspace. This inner product allows to restore the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials and also restores the hermiticity of a class of Schroedinger operators in superspace.

Given an n-dimensional manifold W, a topological arbiter associates a value 0 or 1 to codimension zero submanifolds of W, subject to natural topological and duality axioms. For example, there is a unique arbiter on , which reports the location of the essential 1-cycle. In contrast, we show that there exists an uncountable collection of topological arbiters in dimension 4. Families of arbiters, not induced by homology, are also shown to exist in higher dimensions. The technical ingredients underlying the four dimensional results are secondary obstructions to generalized link-slicing problems. For classical links in the 3-sphere the construction relies on the existence of nilpotent embedding obstructions in dimension 4, reflected in particular by the Milnor group. In higher dimensions novel arbiters are produced using nontrivial squares in stable homotopy theory. The concept of \"topological arbiter\" derives from percolation and from 4-dimensional surgery. It is not the purpose of this paper to advance either of these subjects, but rather to study the concept for its own sake. However in appendices we give both an application to percolation, and the current understanding of the relationship between arbiters and surgery.

Two cases have been developed in the classical theory, namely the and the Loewner evolutions, referring to the associated families of holomorphic self-mappings being normalized at an internal or boundary point of the reference domain, respectively. Recently there has been introduced a new approach [arXiv:0807.1594v1, arXiv:0807.1715v1, arXiv:0902.3116v1] bringing together, and containing as quite special cases, radial and chordal variants of Loewner Theory.

As an answer to this question we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of simply connected domains to be the range of a generalized Loewner chain of chordal type. We also provide an easy-to-check geometric sufficient condition for that.

This is an order-unit space with some specific properties. It becomes a Jordan operator algebra under a certain set of additional conditions, but does not own a multiplication operation in the most general case. A major objective of the present paper is the search for such examples of the structure mentioned above that do not stem from Jordan operator algebras; first natural candidates are matrix algebras over the octonions and other nonassociative rings. Therefore, the case when a nonassociative commutative multiplication exists is studied without assuming that it satisfies the Jordan condition. The characteristics of the resulting algebra are analyzed. This includes the uniqueness of the spectral resolution as well as a criterion for its existence, subalgebras that are Jordan algebras, associative subalgebras, and more different levels of compatibility than occurring in standard quantum mechanics. However, the paper cannot provide the desired example, but contribute to the search by the identification of some typical differences between the potential examples and the Jordan operator algebras and by negative results concerning some first natural candidates. The possibility that no such example exists cannot be ruled out. However, this would result in an unexpected new characterization of Jordan operator algebras, which would have a significant impact on quantum axiomatics since some customary axioms (e.g., powerassociativity or the sum postulate for observables) might turn out to be redundant then.", "subjects": "Mathematical Physics (math-ph)", "authors": "Gerd Niestegge,", "date": "2010-2-3"},

Most prior work on interference alignment, however, neglects interference from other nodes in the network not participating in the alignment operation. This paper proposes three generalizations of interference alignment for the multiple-antenna interference channel with multiple users that account for colored noise, which models uncoordinated interference. First, a minimum interference-plus-noise leakage algorithm is presented, and shown to be equivalent to previous subspace methods when noise is spatially white or negligible. A joint minimum mean squared error design is then proposed that jointly optimizes the transmit precoders and receive spatial filters, whereas previous designs neglect the receive spatial filter. This algorithm is shown to be a generalization of previous joint MMSE designs for other system configurations such as the broadcast channel. Finally, a maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio algorithm is developed that is proven to converge, unlike previous maximum SINR algorithms. The latter two designs are shown to have increased complexity due to non-orthogonal precoders, more required iterations, or more channel state knowledge than the min INL or subspace methods. The sum throughput performance of these algorithms is simulated in the context of a network with uncoordinated co-channel interferers not participating in the alignment protocol. It is found that a network with cochannel interference can benefit from employing precoders designed to consider that interference, but in some cases, ignoring the co-channel interference is advantageous.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Steven W.

We generalize this result to more general source and target measures, using a condition on the third derivative of the potential, using two different proofs. The first uses a map , whose inverse is constructed as a flow along an advection field associated to an appropriate heat-diffusion process. The contraction property is then reduced to showing that log-concavity is preserved along the corresponding diffusion semi-group, by using a maximum principle for parabolic PDE. In particular, Caffarelli's original result immediately follows by using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the Pr 'ekopa--Leindler Theorem.

In particular, we prove sharp estimates for the number of zeros in each of these new critical strips, and we explain how they converge, in a very precise, periodic fashion, to their central, critical lines, as k increases. This not only shows that the zeros are not randomly scattered to the right of the line Re(s)=1, but that, in many respects, their two-dimensional distribution eventually becomes much simpler and more predictable than the one-dimensional behavior of the zeros of the zeta function on the line Re(s)=1/2.", "subjects": "Number Theory (math.NT)", "authors": "Thomas Binder, Sebastian Pauli, Filip Saidak,", "date": "2010-2-1"},

Topologically, the local structure is given by the commensurability class of a vertex stabiliser; on the other hand, the action on the tree suggests that the local structure should correspond to the local action of a stabiliser of a vertex on its neighbours. We study the interplay between these different aspects for the special class of groups satisfying Tits' independence property. We show that such a group has few open subgroups if and only if it acts locally primitively. Moreover, we show that it always admits many germs of automorphisms which do not extend to automorphisms, from which we deduce a negative answer to a question by George Willis. Finally, under suitable assumptions, we compute the full group of germs of automorphisms; in some specific cases, these turn out to be simple and compactly generated, thereby providing a new infinite family of examples which generalise Neretin's group of spheromorphisms.

In this paper we introduce the concept of bounded representation of bisectors in finite dimensional real Banach spaces. This useful notion combines the concepts of bisector and shadow boundary of the unit ball, both corresponding with the same spatial direction. The bounded representation visualizes the connection between the topology of bisectors and shadow boundaries (Lemma 1) and gives the possibility to simplify and to extend some known results on radial projections of bisectors. Our main result (Theorem 1) says that in the manifold case the topology of the closed bisector and the topology of its bounded representation are the same; they are closed, -dimensional balls embedded in Euclidean -space in the standard way.", "subjects": "Geometric Topology (math.GT)", "authors": "\u00c1.

Specifically, we investigate the projective representations of the -adic Poincar ' and Galilean groups, using a new variant of the Mackey machine for projective unitary representations of semidirect products of locally compact and second countable (lcsc) groups. We construct the conformal spacetime over -adic fields and discuss the imbedding of the -adic Poincar ' group into the -adic conformal group.

The Ramsey number r(H) of a graph H is the least positive integer N such that every two-coloring of the edges of the complete graph contains a monochromatic copy of H. A famous result of Chv 'atal, R \"dl, Szemer 'edi and Trotter states that there exists a constant c( Delta) such that r(H) leq c( Delta) n for every graph H with n vertices and maximum degree Delta. The important open question is to determine the constant c( Delta). The best results, both due to Graham, R \"dl and Ruci 'nski, state that there are constants c and c' such that 2^ leq c( Delta) leq 2^. We improve this upper bound, showing that there is a constant c for which c( Delta) leq 2^. The induced Ramsey number r_(H) of a graph H is the least positive integer N for which there exists a graph G on N vertices such that every two-coloring of the edges of G contains an induced monochromatic copy of H. Erd Hs conjectured the existence of a constant c such that, for any graph H on n vertices, r_(H) leq 2^. We move a step closer to proving this conjecture, showing that r_ (H) leq 2^.

Choosing decoding candidates based on rate-distortion (R-D) theory, as proposed previously by the authors, currently provides the best performance-versus-complexity trade-off. In this paper, an analysis based on the rate-distortion exponent (RDE) is used to directly minimize the exponential decay rate of the error probability. This enables rigorous bounds on the error probability for finite-length RS codes and leads to modest performance gains. As a byproduct, a numerical method is derived that computes the rate-distortion exponent for independent non-identical sources.
