An application of this last result to information manifolds is considered.

Current solution techniques relax this problem to a weighted, nearest, (positive) semidefinite programming, SDP, completion problem, by using the linear mapping between Euclidean distance matrices, EDM, and semidefinite matrices. The resulting SDP is solved using primal-dual interior point solvers, yielding an expensive and inexact solution. This relaxation is highly degenerate in the sense that the feasible set is restricted to a low dimensional face of the SDP cone, implying that the Slater constraint qualification fails. Cliques in the graph of the SNL problem give rise to this degeneracy in the SDP relaxation. In this paper, we take advantage of the absence of the Slater constraint qualification and derive a technique for the SNL problem, with exact data, that explicitly solves the corresponding rank restricted SDP problem. No SDP solvers are used. For randomly generated instances, we are able to efficiently solve many huge instances of this NP-hard problem to high accuracy, by finding a representation of the minimal face of the SDP cone that contains the SDP matrix representation of the EDM. The main work of our algorithm consists in repeatedly finding the intersection of subspaces that represent the faces of the SDP cone that correspond to cliques of the SNL problem.", "subjects": "Optimization and Control (math.OC)", "authors": "Nathan Krislock, Henry Wolkowicz,", "date": "2010-1-29"},

A geometric analogue is the distortion of the (Riemannian) metric of a (Lie) subgroup when compared to the metric induced from the ambient (Lie) group. The distortion of a subalgebra in an algebra also reflects the degree of complexity of the membership problem for the elements of this algebra in this subalgebra.

We have recently proposed a fast algorithm, called Smoothed (SL0), for this task. Contrary to many other sparse recovery algorithms, SL0 is not based on minimizing the norm, but it tries to directly minimize the norm of the solution. The basic idea of SL0 is optimizing a sequence of certain (continuous) cost functions approximating the norm of a vector.

Two families of precoders are studied: random iid precoders and orthogonal precoders. We analyse their performance in the regime where both the number of sensors k and the number of samples n per sensor tend to infinity at the same rate, that is, k/n tends to c in (0, 1). Contributions are as follows. 1) Using results of random matrix theory and on large Toeplitz matrices, it is proved that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson detector converges exponentially to zero, when the above families of precoders are used. Closed form expressions of the corresponding error exponents are provided. 2) In particular, we propose a practical orthogonal precoding strategy, the Principal Frequencies Strategy (PFS), which achieves the best error exponent among all orthogonal strategies, and which requires very few signaling overhead between the central processor and the nodes of the network. 3) Moreover, when the PFS is used, a simplified low-complexity testing procedure can be implemented at the FC.

Recently, the duality of conformally flat Riemannian manifolds was found by several geometers. In our setting, this duality can be explained via the existence of a two-fold map of the congruent classes of admissible GCF-manifolds into that of frontals in H^. It should be remarked that the dual conformally flat metric may have degenerate points even when the original conformally flat metric is positive definite. This is the reason why we consider conformally flat manifolds with singular points. In fact, the duality is an involution on the set of admissible GCF-manifolds. The case n=2 requires an exceptional treatment, since any Riemannian 2-manifolds are conformally flat.

This model, known as the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of wireless medium and interference. Avestimehr et al. showed that the Min-cut Max-flow theorem holds in the ADT network. In this paper, we show that the ADT network model can be described within the algebraic network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove that the ADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, called the \"system matrix\". We show that the min-cut of an ADT network is the rank of the system matrix; thus, eliminating the need to optimize over exponential number of cuts between two nodes to compute the min-cut of an ADT network. We extend the capacity characterization for ADT networks to a more general set of connections. Our algebraic approach not only provides the Min-cut Max-flow theorem for a single unicast/multicast connection, but also extends to non-multicast connections such as multiple multicast, disjoint multicast, and two-level multicast. We also provide sufficiency conditions for achievability in ADT networks for any general connection set. In addition, we show that the random linear network coding, a randomized distributed algorithm for network code construction, achieves capacity for the connections listed above. Finally, we extend the ADT networks to those with random erasures and cycles (thus, allowing bi-directional links). Note that ADT network was proposed for approximating the wireless networks; however, ADT network is acyclic. Furthermore, ADT network does not model the stochastic nature of the wireless links.

To begin with, we find a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic causal rate-distortion function (RDF) under such distortion measure, denoted by , for first-order Gauss-Markov processes. Rc^(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) by any causal source code, namely Rc^(D). We show that, for Gaussian sources, the latter can also be upper bounded as Rc^(D) leq Rc^(D) + 0.5 log_(2 pi e) bits/sample. In order to analyze for arbitrary zero-mean Gaussian stationary sources, we introduce bar(D), the information-theoretic causal RDF when the reconstruction error is jointly stationary with the source. Based upon bar(D), we derive three closed-form upper bounds to the additive rate loss defined as bar(D) - R(D), where R(D) denotes Shannon's RDF. Two of these bounds are strictly smaller than 0.5 bits/sample at all rates. These bounds differ from one another in their tightness and ease of evaluation; the tighter the bound, the more involved its evaluation. We then show that, for any source spectral density and any positive distortion D leq sigma_^, bar(D) can be realized by an AWGN channel surrounded by a unique set of causal pre-, post-, and feedback filters. We show that finding such filters constitutes a convex optimization problem.

The transmitter is assumed to comprise a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, that minimizes the front-end imposed transmit energy penalty. Focusing on discrete complex input alphabets, the energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet to a larger alphabet set prior to precoding. For the common discrete lattice-based relaxation, the problem is found to violate the assumption of replica symmetry and a replica symmetry breaking ansatz is taken. The limiting empirical distribution of the precoder's output, as well as the limiting energy penalty, are derived for one-step replica symmetry breaking. For convex relaxations, replica symmetry is found to hold and corresponding results are obtained for comparison. Particularizing to a \"zero-forcing\" (ZF) linear front-end, and non-cooperative users, a decoupling result is derived according to which the channel observed by each of the individual receivers can be effectively characterized by the Markov chain u-x-y, where u, x, and y are the channel input, the equivalent precoder output, and the channel output, respectively. For discrete lattice-based alphabet relaxation, the impact of replica symmetry breaking is demonstrated for the energy penalty at the transmitter. An analysis of spectral efficiency is provided to compare discrete lattice-based relaxations against convex relaxations, as well as linear ZF and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Focusing on quaternary phase shift-keying (QPSK), significant performance gains of both lattice and convex relaxations are revealed compared to linear ZF precoding, for medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

The goal is to allow for a reduced delay collection by a data collector who accesses the network at a random position and random time. Data dissemination is performed by a set of relays which form a circular route to exchange source packets. The storage nodes within the transmission range of the route's relays linearly combine and store overheard relay transmissions using random decentralized strategies. An intelligent data collector first collects a minimum set of coded packets from a subset of storage nodes in its proximity, which might be sufficient for recovering the original packets and, by using a message-passing decoder, attempts recovering all original source packets from this set. Whenever the decoder stalls, the source packet which restarts decoding is polled/doped from its original source node. The random-walk-based analysis of the decoding/doping process furnishes the collection delay analysis with a prediction on the number of required doped packets. The number of doped packets can be surprisingly small when employed with an Ideal Soliton code degree distribution and, hence, the doping strategy may have the least collection delay when the density of source nodes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we demonstrate that network coding makes dissemination more efficient at the expense of a larger collection delay. Not surprisingly, a circular network allows for a significantly more (analytically and otherwise) tractable strategies relative to a network whose model is a random geometric graph.", "subjects": "Information Theory (cs.IT)", "authors": "Silvija Kokalj-Filipovic, Predrag Spasojevic, Emina Soljanin,", "date": "2010-1-21"},

In all three protocols, we assume no cooperation across relay nodes for encoding and decoding. Numerical evaluation in illustrative example networks and comparison with cheap relay cut-set bounds for half-duplex networks show that the proposed MDF protocols approach capacity in some ranges of channel gains. The main idea in the design of the protocols is the use of coding in interference networks that are created in different states or modes of a half-duplex network.
