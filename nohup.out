	{'abstract': u'We prove that a Ricci curvature based method of triangulation of compact Riemannian manifolds, due to Grove and Petersen, extends to the context of weighted Riemannian manifolds and more general metric measure spaces. In both cases the role of the lower bound on Ricci curvature is replaced by the curvature-dimension condition . We show also that for weighted Riemannian manifolds the triangulation can be improved to become a thick one and that, in consequence, such manifolds admit weight-sensitive quasimeromorphic mappings. An application of this last result to information manifolds is considered. Further more, we extend to weak spaces the results of Kanai regarding the discretization of manifolds, and show that the volume growth of such a space is the same as that of any of its discretizations.',

	{'abstract': u'The sensor network localization, SNL, problem in embedding dimension r, consists of locating the positions of wireless sensors, given only the distances between sensors that are within radio range and the positions of a subset of the sensors (called anchors). Current solution techniques relax this problem to a weighted, nearest, (positive) semidefinite programming, SDP, completion problem, by using the linear mapping between Euclidean distance matrices, EDM, and semidefinite matrices. The resulting SDP is solved using primal-dual interior point solvers, yielding an expensive and inexact solution. This relaxation is highly degenerate in the sense that the feasible set is restricted to a low dimensional face of the SDP cone, implying that the Slater constraint qualification fails. Cliques in the graph of the SNL problem give rise to this degeneracy in the SDP relaxation. In this paper, we take advantage of the absence of the Slater constraint qualification and derive a technique for the SNL problem, with exact data, that explicitly solves the corresponding rank restricted SDP problem. No SDP solvers are used. For randomly generated instances, we are able to efficiently solve many huge instances of this NP-hard problem to high accuracy, by finding a representation of the minimal face of the SDP cone that contains the SDP matrix representation of the EDM. The main work of our algorithm consists in repeatedly finding the intersection of subspaces that represent the faces of the SDP cone that correspond to cliques of the SNL problem.',

	{'abstract': u'A tame filtration of an algebra is defined by the growth of its terms, which has to be majorated by an exponential function. A particular case is the degree filtration used in the definition of the growth of finitely generated algebras. The notion of tame filtration is useful in the study of possible distortion of degrees of elements when one algebra is embedded as a subalgebra in another. A geometric analogue is the distortion of the (Riemannian) metric of a (Lie) subgroup when compared to the metric induced from the ambient (Lie) group. The distortion of a subalgebra in an algebra also reflects the degree of complexity of the membership problem for the elements of this algebra in this subalgebra. One of our goals here is to investigate, mostly in the case of associative or Lie algebras, if a tame filtration of an algebra can be induced from the degree filtration of a larger algebra.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work it is shown that certain interesting types of quasi-orthogonal system of subalgebras (whose existence cannot be ruled out by the trivial necessary conditions) cannot exist. In particular, it is proved that there is no quasi-orthogonal decomposition of M_n(C) otimes M_n(C) equiv M_(C) into a number of maximal abelian subalgebras and factors isomorphic to M_n(C) in which the number of factors would be 1 or 3. In addition, some new tools are introduced, too: for example, a quantity c(A,B), which measures "how close" the subalgebras A,B subset M_n(C) are to being quasi-orthogonal. It is shown that in the main cases of interest, c(A\',B\') - where A\' and B\' are the commutants of A and B, respectively - can be determined by c(A,B) and the dimensions of A and B. The corresponding formula is used to find some further obstructions regarding quasi-orthogonal systems.',

(1) We are given partial, and partly erroneous, knowledge of the signal\'s support, denoted by . (2) We are also given an erroneous estimate of the signal values on , denoted by . In practice, both these may be available from available prior knowledge. Alternatively, in recursive reconstruction applications, like real-time dynamic MRI, one can use the support estimate and the signal value estimate from the previous time instant as and . In this work, we introduce regularized modified-BPDN (reg-mod-BPDN) and obtain computable bounds on its reconstruction error. Reg-mod-BPDN tries to find the signal that is sparsest outside the set , while being "close enough" to on and while satisfying the data constraint. Corresponding results for modified-BPDN and BPDN follow as direct corollaries. A second key contribution is an approach to obtain computable error bounds that hold without any sufficient conditions. This makes it easy to compare the bounds for the various approaches. Empirical reconstruction error comparisons with many existing approaches are also provided.',

	{'abstract': u'Continuous models used in physics and other areas of mathematics applications become discrete when they are computerized, e.g., utilized for computations. Besides, computers are controlling processes in discrete spaces, such as films and television programs. At the same time, continuous models that are in the background of discrete representations use mathematical technology developed for continuous media. The most important example of such a technology is calculus, which is so useful in physics and other sciences. The main goal of this paper is to synthesize continuous features and powerful technology of the classical calculus with the discrete approach of numerical mathematics and computational physics. To do this, we further develop the theory of fuzzy continuous functions and apply this theory to functions defined on discrete sets. The main interest is the classical Intermediate Value theorem. Although the result of this theorem is completely based on continuity, utilization of a relaxed version of continuity called fuzzy continuity, allows us to prove discrete versions of the Intermediate Value theorem. This result provides foundations for a new approach to discrete dynamics.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose new semi-implicit numerical methods for the integration of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation with built-in angular momentum conservation. The performance of the proposed integrators is tested on the 1D Heisenberg chain. For this system, our schemes show better stability properties and allow us to use considerably larger time steps than standard explicit methods. At the same time, these semi-implicit schemes are also of comparable accuracy to and computationally much cheaper than the standard midpoint implicit method. The results are of key importance for atomistic spin dynamics simulations and the study of spin dynamics beyond the macro spin approximation.',

	{'abstract': u"We propose two nonlinear Kalman smoothers that rely on Student's t distributions. The T-Robust smoother finds the maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) solution for Gaussian process noise and Student's t observation noise, and is extremely robust against outliers, outperforming the recently proposed l1-Laplace smoother in extreme situations (e.g. 50% or more outliers). The second estimator, which we call the T-Trend smoother, is able to follow sudden changes in the process model, and is derived as a MAP solver for a model with Student's t-process noise and Gaussian observation noise. We design specialized methods to solve both problems which exploit the special structure of the Student's t-distribution, and provide a convergence theory. Both smoothers can be implemented with only minor modifications to an existing L2 smoother implementation. Numerical results for linear and nonlinear models illustrating both robust and fast tracking applications are presented.",

The free terms are nonlinear with Lipschitz continuous coefficients. Under suitable conditions on the covariance measure, Dalang and Sanz-Sol \'e [Memoirs of the AMS, Vol 199, 2009] have proved the existence of a random field solution with H "older continuous sample paths, jointly in both arguments, time and space. By perturbing the driving noise with a multiplicative parameter , a family of probability laws corresponding to the respective solutions to the equation is obtained. Using the weak convergence approach to large deviations developed in [P. Dupuis, R. S. Ellis, 1997], we prove that this family satisfies a Laplace principle in the H "older norm.',

By extending the parametrizations to quasisymmetries, we show that this semigroup is a quotient of the Teichmueller space of doubly-connected Riemann surfaces by a Z action. Furthermore, the semigroup can be given a complex structure in two distinct, natural ways.

If M&lt;=0, D(M) is embedded and it is called unduloid, if M&gt;0, D(M) is not embedded and it is called nodoid. These surfaces are called Delaunays and they are foliated by circles. The trace of the focus in the construction above is called the profile curve of the Delaunay and it is transversal to the circles. Another well known family of constant mean curvature surfaces are the Twizzlers, they are foliated by helices and we can naturally define a profile curve which is transversal to the helices. To make the presentation in this abstract easier, we will be only considering Twizzlers with mean curvature 1. In this paper we will prove that if we roll the profile curve of a Twizzler on a line in a plane and, simultaneously, we move the points in the line at the same speed, so that the rolling motion of the profile curve looks like if it were placed on a treadmill, then, the trace made by the origin of the profile curve is one of the closed heart-shaped curves HS(M,w)= for some M&gt;-1/4 and w&gt;0.

	{'abstract': u'We revisit the adaptive Lasso as well as the thresholded Lasso with refitting, in a high-dimensional linear model, and study prediction error, -error (), and number of false positive selections. Our theoretical results for the two methods are, at a rather fine scale, comparable. The differences only show up in terms of the (minimal) restricted and sparse eigenvalues, favoring thresholding over the adaptive Lasso. As regards prediction and estimation, the difference is virtually negligible, but our bound for the number of false positives is larger for the adaptive Lasso than for thresholding. Moreover, both these two-stage methods add value to the one-stage Lasso in the sense that, under appropriate restricted and sparse eigenvalue conditions, they have similar prediction and estimation error as the one-stage Lasso, but substantially less false positives.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a generic diffusion on the 1D torus and give a simple representation formula for the large deviation rate functional of its invariant probability measure, in the limit of vanishing noise. Previously, this rate functional had been characterized by M.I. Freidlin and A.D. Wentzell as solution of a rather complex optimization problem. We discuss this last problem in full generality and show that it leads to our formula. We express the rate functional by means of a geometric transformation that, with a Maxwell-like construction, creates flat regions. We then consider piecewise deterministic Markov processes on the 1D torus and show that the corresponding large deviation rate functional for the stationary distribution is obtained by applying the same transformation. Inspired by this, we prove a universality result showing that the transformation generates viscosity solution of stationary Hamilton--Jacobi equation associated to any Hamiltonian satisfying suitable weak conditions.',

We propose a message-passing based scheme for detecting correlated sources directly, with no need for source coding. The detection is done simultaneously over a block of transmitted binary symbols (word). Simulation results are provided demonstrating a substantial improvement in bit-error-rate in comparison with the unmodified detector and the alternative of source compression. The robustness of the error-performance improvement is shown under practical model settings, including wrong estimation of the generating Markov transition matrix and finite-length spreading codes.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the Linear Programming (LP) solution of the Compressed Sensing (CS) problem over reals, also known as the Basis Pursuit (BasP) algorithm. The BasP allows interpretation as a channel-coding problem, and it guarantees error-free reconstruction with a properly chosen measurement matrix and sufficiently sparse error vectors. In this manuscript, we examine how the BasP performs on a given measurement matrix and develop an algorithm to discover the sparsest vectors for which the BasP fails. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of our previous results on finding the most probable error-patterns degrading performance of a finite size Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code in the error-floor regime. The BasP fails when its output is different from the actual error-pattern. We design a CS-Instanton Search Algorithm (ISA) generating a sparse vector, called a CS-instanton, such that the BasP fails on the CS-instanton, while the BasP recovery is successful for any modification of the CS-instanton replacing a nonzero element by zero. We also prove that, given a sufficiently dense random input for the error-vector, the CS-ISA converges to an instanton in a small finite number of steps. The performance of the CS-ISA is illustrated on a randomly generated matrix. For this example, the CS-ISA outputs the shortest instanton (error vector) pattern of length 11.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we prove the existence of non-negative solutions for a non-local higher order degenerate parabolic equation arising in the modeling of hydraulic fractures. The equation is similar to the well-known thin film equation, but the Laplace operator is replaced by a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, corresponding to the square root of the Laplace operator on a bounded domain with Neumann boundary conditions (which can also be defined using the periodic Hilbert transform). In our study, we have to deal with the usual difficulty associated to higher order equations (e.g. lack of maximum principle). However, there are important differences with, for instance, the thin film equation: First, our equation is nonlocal; Also the natural energy estimate is not as good as in the case of the thin film equation, and does not yields, for instance, boundedness and continuity of the solutions (our case is critical in dimension in that respect).',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we obtain a new abstract formula relating eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator to two families of symmetric and skew-symmetric operators and their commutators. This formula generalizes earlier ones obtained by Harrell, Stubbe, Hook, Ashbaugh, Hermi, Levitin and Parnovski. We also show how one can use this abstract formulation both for giving dierent and simpler proofs for all the known results obtained for the eigenvalues of a power of the Laplace operator (i.e. the Dirichlet Laplacian, the clamped plate problem for the bilaplacian and more generally for the polyharmonic problem on a bounded Euclidean domain) and to obtain new ones. In a last paragraph, we derive new bounds for eigenvalues of any power of the Kohn Laplacian on the Heisenberg group.',

	{'abstract': u'Sigma-Delta modulation is a popular method for analog-to-digital conversion of bandlimited signals that employs coarse quantization coupled with oversampling. The standard mathematical model for the error analysis of the method measures the performance of a given scheme by the rate at which the associated reconstruction error decays as a function of the oversampling ratio . It was recently shown that exponential accuracy of the form can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma-Delta modulation schemes. By general information-entropy arguments must be less than 1. The current best known value for is approximately 0.088. The schemes that were designed to achieve this accuracy employ the "greedy" quantization rule coupled with feedback filters that fall into a class we call "minimally supported". In this paper, we study the minimization problem that corresponds to optimizing the error decay rate for this class of feedback filters. We solve a relaxed version of this problem exactly and provide explicit asymptotics of the solutions. From these relaxed solutions, we find asymptotically optimal solutions of the original problem, which improve the best known exponential error decay rate to . Our method draws from the theory of orthogonal polynomials; in particular, it relates the optimal filters to the zero sets of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.',

	{'abstract': u'Finding the sparse solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations has many applications, especially, it is used in Compressed Sensing (CS), Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), and sparse decomposition of signals on overcomplete dictionaries. We have recently proposed a fast algorithm, called Smoothed (SL0), for this task. Contrary to many other sparse recovery algorithms, SL0 is not based on minimizing the norm, but it tries to directly minimize the norm of the solution. The basic idea of SL0 is optimizing a sequence of certain (continuous) cost functions approximating the norm of a vector. However, in previous papers, we did not provide a complete convergence proof for SL0. In this paper, we study the convergence properties of SL0, and show that under a certain sparsity constraint in terms of Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP), and with a certain choice of parameters, the convergence of SL0 to the sparsest solution is guaranteed. Moreover, we study the complexity of SL0, and we show that whenever the dimension of the dictionary grows, the complexity of SL0 increases with the same order as Matching Pursuit (MP), which is one of the fastest existing sparse recovery methods, while contrary to MP, its convergence to the sparsest solution is guaranteed under certain conditions which are satisfied through the choice of parameters.',

We start by showing how MSG systems can be viewed as a general class of periodic functions. Next, periodic and step-like solutions of these systems are discussed in some details. In particular, we study the static properties of such systems by considering slope and phase diagrams. We also use concepts like energy density and pressure to characterize and distinguish such solutions. We interpret these solutions as an interacting many body system, in which kinks and antikinks behave as extended particles. Finally, we provide a linear stability analysis of periodic solutions which indicates short wavelength solutions to be stable.',

In order to produce the main results we deal with correspondences on the k-fold symmetric product of C, with some interesting linear subspaces of mathbb^n enjoying a condition of Cayley-Bacharach type, and with monodromy of rational maps.

This operator corresponds the boundary measurements when we have smooth sources supported on and the fields produced by these sources are observed on . We show that when and are disjoint but their closures intersect at least at one point, then the restricted Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator determines the Riemannian manifold and the metric on it up to an isometry. In the Euclidian space, the result yields that an anisotropic wave speed inside a compact body is determined, up to a natural coordinate transformations, by measurements on the boundary of the body even when wave sources are kept away from receivers. Moreover, we show that if we have three arbitrary non-empty open subsets , and of the boundary, then the restricted Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators for determine the Riemannian manifold to an isometry.

	{'abstract': u'Inspired by some intriguing examples, we study uniform association schemes and uniform coherent configurations, including cometric Q-antipodal association schemes. After a review of imprimitivity, we show that an imprimitive association scheme is uniform if and only if it is dismantlable, and we cast these schemes in the broader context of certain --- uniform --- coherent configurations. We also give a third characterization of uniform schemes in terms of the Krein parameters, and derive information on the primitive idempotents of such a scheme. In the second half of the paper, we apply these results to cometric association schemes. We show that each such scheme is uniform if and only if it is Q-antipodal, and derive results on the parameters of the subschemes and dismantled schemes of cometric Q-antipodal schemes. We revisit the correspondence between uniform indecomposable three-class schemes and linked systems of symmetric designs, and show that these are cometric Q-antipodal. We obtain a characterization of cometric Q-antipodal four-class schemes in terms of only a few parameters, and show that any strongly regular graph with a ("non-exceptional") strongly regular decomposition gives rise to such a scheme. Hemisystems in generalized quadrangles provide interesting examples of such decompositions. We finish with a short discussion of five-class schemes as well as a list of all feasible parameter sets for cometric Q-antipodal four-class schemes with at most six fibres and fibre size at most 2000, and describe the known examples. Most of these examples are related to groups, codes, and geometries.',

	{'abstract': u'Using a new method [9] it is possible to derive mean field equations from the microscopic N-body Schrodinger evolution of interacting particles without using BBGKY hierarchies. Recently this method was used to derive the Hartree equation for singular interactions [4] and the Gross Pitaevskii equation without positivity condition on the interaction [10] where one had to restrict the scaling behaviour of the interaction. In this paper more general scalings shall be considered assuming positivity of the interaction.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider locally conformal Kaehler geometry as an equivariant, homothetic Kaehler geometry (K, Gamma). We show that the de Rham class of the Lee form can be naturally identified with the homomorphism projecting Gamma to its dilation factors, thus completing the description of locally conformal Kaehler geometry in this equivariant setting. The rank r of a locally conformal Kaehler manifold is the rank of the image of this homomorphism. Using algebraic number theory, we show that r is non-trivial, providing explicit examples of locally conformal Kaehler manifolds with 1&lt;r&lt;b_1. As far as we know, these are the first examples of this kind. Moreover, we prove that locally conformal Kaehler Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds have either r=b_1 or r=b_1/2.',

We consider two classes of systems in n spatial dimensions, which respectively describe a point particle in a central force field and a freely rotating rigid body. In the former case, the application of the general methods to an integrable classical system leads in an almost straightforward way to the quasi-integrability of the corresponding quantum system. In the latter case instead, a modification of the symmetrization procedure is necessary in order to achieve quantum integrability for n=6.',

	{'abstract': u'On the set of mappings of the given set, we define the product of mappings. If A is associative algebra, then we consider the set of matrices, whose elements are linear mappings of algebra A. In algebra of matrices of linear mappings we define the operation of product. The operation is based on the product of mappings. If the matrix a of linear mappings has an inverse matrix, then the quasideterminant of the matrix a and the inverse matrix are matrices of linear mappings. In the paper, I consider conditions when a matrix of linear mappings has inverse matrix, as well methods of solving a system of linear equations in an associative algebra.',

These convex bodies give information about the Hilbert function as well as multiplicities of irreducible representations appearing in the graded algebra. We extend the notion of Duistermaat-Heckman measure to graded G-algebras and prove a Fujita type approximation theorem and a Brunn-Minkowski inequality for this measure. This in particular applies to arbitrary G-line bundles giving an equivariant version of the theory of volumes of line bundles. We generalize the Brion-Kazarnowski formula for the degree of a spherical variety to arbitrary G-varieties. Our approach follows some of the previous works of A. Okounkov. We use the asymptotic theory of semigroups of integral points and Newton-Okounkov bodies developed in our ealier work arXiv:0904.3350',

	{'abstract': u"The contraction of the Poincare group with respect to the space trans- lations subgroup gives rise to a group that bears a certain duality relation to the Galilei group, that is, the contraction limit of the Poincare group with respect to the time translations subgroup. In view of this duality, we call the former the dual Galilei group. A rather remarkable feature of the dual Galilei group is that the time translations constitute a central subgroup. Therewith, in unitary irreducible representations (UIR) of the group, the Hamiltonian appears as a Casimir operator proportional to the identity H = EI, with E (and a spin value s) uniquely characterizing the representation. Hence, a physical system characterized by a UIR of the dual Galilei group displays no non-trivial time evolution. Moreover, the combined U(1) gauge group and the dual Galilei group underlie a non- relativistic limit of Maxwell's equations known as the electric limit. The analysis presented here shows that only electrostatics is possible for the electric limit, wholly in harmony with the trivial nature of time evolution governed by the dual Galilei group.",

First, we find them by solving the -eigenvalue equations, using a method that can be applied to potentials that are polynomial in an exponential. A Mellin transform converts the -eigenvalue equations to difference equations, and factorized solutions are found directly for all values of the parameters. The symbols of both diagonal and off-diagonal density operator elements in the energy basis are found this way. The Wigner transforms of the density matrices built from the known wave functions are then shown to confirm the solutions.',

We prove that the logarithm of the analytic torsion of the cone decomposes as the sum of the logarithm of the root of the analytic torsion of the boundary of the cone, plus a topological term, plus a further term that is a rational linear combination of local Riemannian invariants of the boundary. We also prove that this last term coincides with the anomaly boundary term appearing in the Cheeger Muller theorem for a manifold with boundary, according to Bruning and Ma, either in the case that W is an odd sphere or has dimension smaller than six. It follows in particular that the Cheeger Muller theorem holds for the cone over an odd dimensional sphere. We also prove Poincare duality for the analytic torsion of a cone.',

	{'abstract': u'We determine the rate region of the Gaussian scalar-help-vector source-coding problem under a covariance matrix distortion constraint. The rate region is achieved by a Gaussian achievable scheme. We introduce a novel outer bounding technique to establish the converse of the main result. Our approach is based on lower bounding the problem with a potentially reduced dimensional problem by projecting the main source and imposing the distortion constraint in certain directions determined by the optimal Gaussian scheme. We also prove several properties that the optimal solution to the point-to-point rate-distortion problem for a vector Gaussian source under a covariance matrix distortion constraint satisfies. These properties play an important role in our converse proof. We further establish an outer bound to the rate region of the more general problem in which there are distortion constraints on both the sources. The outer bound is partially tight in general. We also study its tightness in some nontrivial cases.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the performance of the Neyman-Pearson detection of a stationary Gaussian process in noise, using a large wireless sensor network (WSN). In our model, each sensor compresses its observation sequence using a linear precoder. The final decision is taken by a fusion center (FC) based on the compressed information. Two families of precoders are studied: random iid precoders and orthogonal precoders. We analyse their performance in the regime where both the number of sensors k and the number of samples n per sensor tend to infinity at the same rate, that is, k/n tends to c in (0, 1). Contributions are as follows. 1) Using results of random matrix theory and on large Toeplitz matrices, it is proved that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson detector converges exponentially to zero, when the above families of precoders are used. Closed form expressions of the corresponding error exponents are provided. 2) In particular, we propose a practical orthogonal precoding strategy, the Principal Frequencies Strategy (PFS), which achieves the best error exponent among all orthogonal strategies, and which requires very few signaling overhead between the central processor and the nodes of the network. 3) Moreover, when the PFS is used, a simplified low-complexity testing procedure can be implemented at the FC. We show that the proposed suboptimal test enjoys the same error exponent as the Neyman-Pearson test, which indicates a similar asymptotic behaviour of the performance. We illustrate our findings by numerical experiments on some examples.',

The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by numerical examples.',

We illustrate how fractional sums can be used to derive infinite sum and special functions identities; the corresponding proofs turn out to be particularly simple and intuitive.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the so-called MIMO interference channel. This situation has relevance in applications such as multi-cell coordination in cellular networks as well as spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks among others. We address the design of precoding (i.e. beamforming) vectors at each sender with the aim of striking a compromise between beamforming gain at the intended receiver (Egoism) and the mitigation of interference created towards other receivers (Altruism). Combining egoistic and altruistic beamforming has been shown previously to be instrumental to optimizing the rates in a MISO interference channel (i.e. where receivers have no interference canceling capability) . Here we explore these game-theoretic concepts in the more general context of MIMO channels and using the framework of Bayesian games, allowing us to derive (semi-)distributed precoding techniques. We draw parallels with existing work on the MIMO interference channel, including rate-optimizing and interference-alignement precoding techniques, showing how such techniques may be improved and re-interpretated through a common prism based on balancing egoistic and altruistic beamforming.',

We determine a condition for quantum operators which can be a suitable replacement for the condition of functional independence for functions on the classical phase space. This condition is based on the properties of the main parts of the operators with respect to the momenta. We are led in this way to the definition of what we call a "quasi-integrable quantum system". This concept will be further developed in a series of following papers.',

	{'abstract': u"Recently, Scullard and Ziff noticed that a broad class of planar percolation models are self-dual under a simple condition that, in a parametrized version of such a model, reduces to a single equation. They state that the solution of the resulting equation gives the critical point. However, just as in the classical case of bond percolation on the square lattice, self-duality is simply the starting point: the mathematical difficulty is precisely showing that self-duality implies criticality. Here we do so for a generalization of the models considered by Scullard and Ziff. In these models, the states of the bonds need not be independent; furthermore, increasing events need not be positively correlated, so new techniques are needed in the analysis. The main new ingredients are a generalization of Harris's Lemma to products of partially ordered sets, and a new proof of a type of Russo-Seymour-Welsh Lemma with minimal symmetry assumptions.",

This choice, motivated by the analyticity of the underlying eigenfunctions, allows for a convergence of infinite order, as rigorously demonstrated through a priori error bounds when Chebyshev nodes are adopted.

The paper studies measurable functions f for which is closable in the norm topology or in the weak* topology. We obtain a characterisation of w*-closable multipliers and relate the question about norm closability to the theory of operator synthesis. We also study multipliers of two special types: if f is of Toeplitz type, that is, if f(x,y)=h(x-y), x,y in G, where G is a locally compact abelian group, then the closability of f is related to the local inclusion of h in the Fourier algebra A(G) of G.

These methods not only yield the linearizing transformations but also the solutions of the nonlinear equations. Here complex methods for a scalar ordinary differential equation are used for linearizing systems of two second-order ordinary and partial differential equations, which can use the power of the geometric method for writing the solutions.

	{'abstract': u'The Noether-like operators that play an essential role in writing down the invariants for systems of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are constructed. The classification of such operators is carried out with the help of analytic continuation of the Lagrangians on the line. Cases in which the Noether-like operators are also Noether symmetries for the systems of ODEs are briefly mentioned. In particular, the 8-dimensional maximal Noether subalgebra is remarkabely obtained for the simplest system of the free particle equations in two dimensions from the 5-dimensional complex Noether algebra. We present the effectivness of Noether-like operators as well as the determination of all first integrals of systems of nonlinear differential equation which have not been reported before. This study gives a new direction to construct first integrals for systems of nonlinear differential equations.',

Denote by Gr(d,A) the Grassmannian of d-subspaces of A (viewed as a k-vector space), and by GL_1(A) the algebraic k-group whose points are invertible elements of A. The group GL_1(A) acts naturally on Gr(d,A) (by the formula g.E=gE). The aim of this paper is to study some birational properties of this action. More precisely, let r be the gcd of d and dim(A). Under some hypothesis on A (satisfied if A/k is 'etale), I show that the variety Gr(d,A) is birationally and GL_1(A)-equivariantly isomorphic to the product of Gr(r,A) by a projective space (on which GL_1(A) acts trivially). By twisting, this result has some corollaries in the theory of central simple algebras. For instance, let B and C be two central simple algebras over k, of coprime degrees. Then the Severi-Brauer variety SB(B otimes C) is birational to the product of SB(B) times SB(C) by an affine space of the correct dimension. These corollaries are in the spirit of Krashen's generalized version of Amitsur's conjecture.",

The key idea is to simultaneously decode the combined interference signal and the intended message at each receiver. It is shown that this interference-decoding inner bound is tight under certain strong interference conditions. The inner bound is also shown to strictly contain the inner bound obtained by treating interference as noise, which includes interference alignment for deterministic channels. The gain comes from judicious analysis of the number of combined interference sequences in different regimes of input distributions and message rates. Finally, the inner bound is generalized to the case where each channel output is observed through a noisy channel.',

	{'abstract': u'In a joint work with Saji, the second and the third authors gave an intrinsic formulation of wave fronts and proved a realization theorem of wave fronts in space forms. As an application, we show that the following four objects are essentially same; * conformally flat n-manifolds (n&gt;=3) with admissible singular points (i.e. admissible GCF-manifolds), * frontals as hypersurfaces in the lightcone Q^_+, * frontals as hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space H^, * sapacelike frontals as hypersurfaces in the de Sitter space S^_1. Recently, the duality of conformally flat Riemannian manifolds was found by several geometers. In our setting, this duality can be explained via the existence of a two-fold map of the congruent classes of admissible GCF-manifolds into that of frontals in H^. It should be remarked that the dual conformally flat metric may have degenerate points even when the original conformally flat metric is positive definite. This is the reason why we consider conformally flat manifolds with singular points. In fact, the duality is an involution on the set of admissible GCF-manifolds. The case n=2 requires an exceptional treatment, since any Riemannian 2-manifolds are conformally flat. At the end of this paper, we also determine the moduli space of isometric immersions of a given simply connected Riemannian 2-manifold into the lightcone Q^_+.',

We prove that the self-intersection number is bounded above by L^2/4 + L/2 - 1, and that when L is even, this bound is sharp; in that case there are exactly four distinct classes attaining that bound. When L is odd, we establish a smaller, conjectured upper bound ((L^2 - 1)/4)) in certain cases; and there we show it is sharp. Furthermore, for the doubly-punctured plane, these self-intersection numbers are bounded below, by L/2 - 1 if L is even, (L - 1)/2 if L is odd; these bounds are sharp.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is to give a geometric construction of the Bethe algebra (of Hamiltonians) of a Gaudin model associated to a simple Lie algebra. More precisely, in this paper a quantum integrable model is assigned to a weighted arrangement of affine hyperplanes. We show (under certain assumptions) that the algebra of Hamiltonians of the model is isomorphic to the algebra of functions on the critical set of the corresponding master function. For a discriminantal arrangement we show (under certain assumptions) that the symmetric part of the algebra of Hamiltonians is isomorphic to the Bethe algebra of the corresponding Gaudin model. It is expected that this correspondence holds in general (without the assumptions). As a byproduct of constructions we show that in a Gaudin model (associated to an arbitrary simple Lie algebra), the Bethe vector, corresponding to an isolated critical point of the master function, is nonzero.',

	{'abstract': u'Optimal binary labelings, input distributions, and input alphabets are analyzed for the so-called bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) capacity, paying special attention to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. For 8-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and for 0.75 bit/symbol, the folded binary code results in a higher capacity than the binary reflected gray code (BRGC) and the natural binary code (NBC). The 1 dB gap between the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) capacity and the BICM capacity with the BRGC can be almost completely removed if the input symbol distribution is properly selected. First-order asymptotics of the BICM capacity for arbitrary input alphabets and distributions, dimensions, mean, variance, and binary labeling are developed. These asymptotics are used to define first-order optimal (FOO) constellations for BICM, i.e. constellations that make BICM achieve the Shannon limit . It is shown that the required for reliable transmission at asymptotically low rates in BICM can be as high as infinity, that for uniform input distributions and 8-PAM there are only 72 classes of binary labelings with a different first-order asymptotic behavior, and that this number is reduced to only 26 for 8-ary phase shift keying (PSK). A general answer to the question of FOO constellations for BICM is also given: using the Hadamard transform, it is found that for uniform input distributions, a constellation for BICM is FOO if and only if it is a linear projection of a hypercube. A constellation based on PAM or quadrature amplitude modulation input alphabets is FOO if and only if they are labeled by the NBC; if the constellation is based on PSK input alphabets instead, it can never be FOO if the input alphabet has more than four points, regardless of the labeling.',

	{'abstract': u'We develop a localisation theory for certain categories, yielding a 3-arrow calculus: Every morphism in the localisation is represented by a diagram of length 3, and two such diagrams represent the same morphism if and only if they can be embedded in a 3-by-3 diagram in an appropriate way. The methods to construct this localisation are similar to the Ore localisation for a 2-arrow calculus; in particular, we do not have to use zigzags of arbitrary length. Applications include the localisation of an arbitrary model category with respect to its weak equivalences as well as the localisation of its full subcategories of cofibrant, fibrant and bifibrant objects, giving the homotopy category in all four cases. In contrast to the approach of Dwyer, Hirschhorn, Kan and Smith, the model category under consideration does not need to admit functorial factorisations. Moreover, our method shows that the derived category of any abelian (or idempotent splitting exact) category admits a 3-arrow calculus if we localise the category of complexes instead of its homotopy category.',

We determined the distribution of the aggregate interference and the error performance of the link. In this second part, we characterize the capacity of the link subject to both network interference and noise. Then, we put forth the concept of spectral outage probability (SOP), a new characterization of the aggregate radio-frequency emission generated by communicating nodes in a wireless network. We present some applications of the SOP, namely the establishment of spectral regulations and the design of covert military networks. The proposed framework captures all the essential physical parameters that affect the aggregate network emission, yet is simple enough to provide insights that may be of value in the design and deployment of wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a mathematical model for communication subject to both network interference and noise. We introduce a framework where the interferers are scattered according to a spatial Poisson process, and are operating asynchronously in a wireless environment subject to path loss, shadowing, and multipath fading. We consider both cases of slow and fast-varying interferer positions. The paper is comprised of two separate parts. In Part I, we determine the distribution of the aggregate network interference at the output of a linear receiver. We characterize the error performance of the link, in terms of average and outage probabilities. The proposed model is valid for any linear modulation scheme (e.g., M-ary phase shift keying or M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation), and captures all the essential physical parameters that affect network interference. Our work generalizes the conventional analysis of communication in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise and fast fading, allowing the traditional results to be extended to include the effect of network interference. In Part II of the paper, we derive the capacity of the link when subject to network interference and noise, and characterize the spectrum of the aggregate interference.',

	{'abstract': u"The level lines of the Gaussian free field are known to be related to SLE(4). It is shown how this relation allows to define chordal SLE(4) processes on doubly connected domains, describing traces that are anchored on one of the two boundary components. The precise nature of the processes depends on the conformally invariant boundary conditions imposed on the second boundary component. Extensions of Schramm's formula to doubly connected domains are given for the standard Dirichlet and Neumann conditions and a relation to first-exit problems for Brownian bridges is established. For the free field compactified at the self-dual radius, the extended symmetry leads to a class of conformally invariant boundary conditions parametrised by elements of SU(2). It is shown how to extend SLE(4) to this setting. This allows for a derivation of new passage probabilities a la Schramm that interpolate continuously from Dirichlet to Neumann conditions.",

Such a map is unique unless the group is two-ended. In order to optimize the proof and the usage of the map theorem we propose two new definitions of relative hyperbolicity equivalent to the other known definitions. In our approach some "visibility" conditions in graphs are essential. We introduce a class of "visibility actions" that contains the class of relatively hyperbolic actions. The convergence property still holds for the visibility actions. We describe and make use a rather general construction of "attractor sum" of two actions of a locally compact group.',

	{'abstract': u'The usual way to investigate the statistical properties of finitely generated subgroups of free groups, and of finite presentations of groups, is based on the so-called word-based distribution: subgroups are generated (finite presentations are determined) by randomly chosen k-tuples of reduced words, whose maximal length is allowed to tend to infinity. In this paper we adopt a different, though equally natural point of view: we investigate the statistical properties of the same objects, but with respect to the so-called graph-based distribution, recently introduced by Bassino, Nicaud and Weil. Here, subgroups (and finite presentations) are determined by randomly chosen Stallings graphs whose number of vertices tends to infinity. Our results show that these two distributions behave quite differently from each other, shedding a new light on which properties of finitely generated subgroups can be considered frequent or rare. For example, we show that malnormal subgroups of a free group are negligible in the graph-based distribution, while they are exponentially generic in the word-based distribution. Quite surprisingly, a random finite presentation generically presents the trivial group in this new distribution, while in the classical one it is known to generically present an infinite hyperbolic group.',

It says that a symmetric real polynomial of degree in variables is positive on (on ) if and only if it is so on the subset of points with at most distinct components. We deduce Timofte's original statement as a corollary of a slightly more general statement on symmetric optimization problems. The idea we are using to prove this statement is to relate it to a linear optimization problem in the orbit space. The fact that for the case of the symmetric group this can be viewed as a question on normalized univariate real polynomials with only real roots allows us to conclude the theorems in a very elementary way. We hope that the methods presented here will make it possible to derive similar statements also in the case of other groups.",

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the properties of the Hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm (HMC) in high dimensions. HMC develops a Markov chain reversible w.r.t. a given target distribution by using separable Hamiltonian dynamics with potential . The additional momentum variables are chosen at random from the Boltzmann distribution and the continuous-time Hamiltonian dynamics are then discretised using the leapfrog scheme. The induced bias is removed via a Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject rule. In the simplified scenario of independent, identically distributed components, we prove that, to obtain an acceptance probability as the dimension of the state space tends to , the leapfrog step-size should be scaled as . Therefore, in high dimensions, HMC requires steps to traverse the state space. We also identify analytically the asymptotically optimal acceptance probability, which turns out to be 0.651 (to three decimal places). This is the choice which optimally balances the cost of generating a proposal, which as increases, against the cost related to the average number of proposals required to obtain acceptance, which as increases.',

We explore the structure of the semilattice of intersections of the hyperplanes for generic reference points. The main theorem is that there is a real, additive gain graph (this is a graph with an additive real number associated invertibly to each edge) whose set of balanced flats has the same structure as the intersection semilattice. We examine the requirements for genericity, which are related to behavior at infinity but remain mysterious; also, variations in the construction rules for perpendiculars. We investigate several particular arrangements with a view to finding the exact numbers of faces of each dimension. The prototype, the arrangement of all perpendicular bisectors, was studied by Good and Tideman, motivated by a geometric voting theory. Most of our particular examples are suggested by extensions of that theory in which voters exercise finer discrimination. Throughout, we propose many research problems.',

	{'abstract': u'The deterministic wireless relay network model, introduced by Avestimehr et al., has been proposed for approximating Gaussian relay networks. This model, known as the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of wireless medium and interference. Avestimehr et al. showed that the Min-cut Max-flow theorem holds in the ADT network. In this paper, we show that the ADT network model can be described within the algebraic network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove that the ADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, called the "system matrix". We show that the min-cut of an ADT network is the rank of the system matrix; thus, eliminating the need to optimize over exponential number of cuts between two nodes to compute the min-cut of an ADT network. We extend the capacity characterization for ADT networks to a more general set of connections. Our algebraic approach not only provides the Min-cut Max-flow theorem for a single unicast/multicast connection, but also extends to non-multicast connections such as multiple multicast, disjoint multicast, and two-level multicast. We also provide sufficiency conditions for achievability in ADT networks for any general connection set. In addition, we show that the random linear network coding, a randomized distributed algorithm for network code construction, achieves capacity for the connections listed above. Finally, we extend the ADT networks to those with random erasures and cycles (thus, allowing bi-directional links). Note that ADT network was proposed for approximating the wireless networks; however, ADT network is acyclic. Furthermore, ADT network does not model the stochastic nature of the wireless links. With our algebraic framework, we incorporate both cycles as well as random failures into ADT network model.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is to describe and clarify as much as possible the 3-dimensional topology underlying the Helmholtz cuts method, which occurs in a wide theoretic and applied literature about Electromagnetism, Fluid dynamics and Elasticity on domains of the ordinary space. We consider two classes of bounded domains that satisfy mild boundary conditions and that become "simple" after a finite number of disjoint cuts along properly embedded surfaces. For the first class (Helmholtz), "simple" means that every curl-free smooth vector field admits a potential. For the second (weakly-Helmholtz), we only require that a potential exists for the restriction of every curl-free smooth vector field defined on the whole initial domain. By means of classical and rather elementary facts of 3-dimensional geometric and algebraic topology, we give an exhaustive description of Helmholtz domains, realizing that their topology is forced to be quite elementary (in particular, Helmholtz domains with connected boundary are just possibly knotted handlebodies, and the complement of any non-trivial link is not Helmholtz). The discussion about weakly-Helmholtz domains is a bit more advanced, and their classification appears to be a quite difficult issue. Nevertheless, we provide several interesting characterizations of them and, in particular, we point out that the class of links with weakly-Helmholtz complements eventually coincides with the class of the so-called homology boundary links, that have been widely studied in Knot Theory.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a computationally-efficient method for recovering sparse signals from a series of noisy observations, known as the problem of compressed sensing (CS). CS theory requires solving a convex constrained minimization problem. We propose to transform this optimization problem into a convex feasibility problem (CFP), and solve it using subgradient projection methods, which are iterative, fast, robust and convergent schemes for solving CFPs. As opposed to some of the recently-introduced CS algorithms, such as Bayesian CS and gradient projections for sparse reconstruction, which become inefficient as the problem dimension and sparseness degree increase, the newly-proposed methods exhibit a marked robustness with respect to these factors. This renders the subgradient projection methods highly viable for large-scale compressible scenarios.',

	{'abstract': u"Training over sparse multipath channels is explored. The energy allocation and the optimal shape of training signals that enable error free communications over unknown channels are characterized as a function of the channels' statistics. The performance of training is evaluated by the reduction of the mean square error of the channel estimate and by the decrease in the uncertainty of the channel. A connection between the entropy of the wideband channel and the required energy for training is shown. In addition, there is a linkage between the sparsity and the entropy of the channel to the number of required channel measurements when the training is based on compressed sensing. The ability to learn the channel from few measurements is connected to the low entropy of sparse channels that enables training in the low SNR regime.",

	{'abstract': u"We show that the discrete complex, and numerous hypercomplex, Fourier transforms defined and used so far by a number of researchers can be unified into a single framework based on a matrix exponential version of Euler's formula , and a matrix root of -1 isomorphic to the imaginary root . The transforms thus defined can be computed using standard matrix multiplications and additions with no hypercomplex code, the complex or hypercomplex algebra being represented by the form of the matrix root of -1, so that the matrix multiplications are equivalent to multiplications in the appropriate algebra. We present examples from the complex, quaternion and biquaternion algebras, and from Clifford algebras Cl1,1 and Cl2,0. The significance of this result is both in the theoretical unification, and also in the scope it affords for insight into the structure of the various transforms, since the formulation is such a simple generalization of the classic complex case. It also shows that hypercomplex discrete Fourier transforms may be computed using standard matrix arithmetic packages without the need for a hypercomplex library, which is of importance in providing a reference implementation for verifying implementations based on hypercomplex code.",

	{'abstract': u'The energy levels of quantum systems are determined by quantization conditions. For one-dimensional anharmonic oscillators, one can transform the Schrodinger equation into a Riccati form, i.e., in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function. A perturbative expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function can easily be obtained. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition can be expressed in terms of a contour integral around the poles of the logarithmic derivative. Its functional form is B_m(E,g) = n + 1/2, where B is a characteristic function of the anharmonic oscillator of degree m, E is the resonance energy, and g is the coupling constant. A recursive scheme can be devised which facilitates the evaluation of higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brioullin (WKB) approximants. The WKB expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function has a cut in the tunneling region. The contour integral about the tunneling region yields the instanton action plus corrections, summarized in a second characteristic function A_m(E,g). The evaluation of A_m(E,g) by the method of asymptotic matching is discussed for the case of the cubic oscillator of degree m=3.',

	{'abstract': u'We address two fundamental questions in the representation theory of affine Hecke algebras of classical types. One is an inductive algorithm to compute characters of tempered modules, and the other is the determination of the constants in the formal degrees of discrete series (in the form conjectured by Reeder cite). The former is completely different than the Lusztig-Shoji algorithm cite, and it is more effective in a number of cases. The main idea in our proof is to introduce a new family of representations which behave like tempered modules, but for which it is easier to analyze the effect of parameter specializations. Our proof also requires a comparison of the -theoretic results of Opdam, Delorme, Slooten, Solleveld cite, and the geometric construction from cite.',

We characterize the reconstruction performance by the critical relation of the successful reconstruction between the ratio and the density of non-zero elements in in the limit while keeping and allowing asymptotically negligible reconstruction errors. We show that the critical relation holds universally as long as can be characterized asymptotically by a rotationally invariant random matrix ensemble and is typically of full rank. This supports the universality of the critical relation observed by Donoho and Tanner (, vol.~367, pp.~4273--4293, 2009; arXiv: 0807.3590) for various ensembles of compression matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'The field of compressed sensing has shown that a sparse but otherwise arbitrary vector can be recovered exactly from a small number of randomly constructed linear projections (or samples). The question addressed in this paper is whether an even smaller number of samples is sufficient when there exists prior knowledge about the distribution of the unknown vector, or when only partial recovery is needed. An information-theoretic lower bound with connections to free probability theory and an upper bound corresponding to a computationally simple thresholding estimator are derived. It is shown that in certain cases (e.g. discrete valued vectors or large distortions) the number of samples can be decreased. Interestingly though, it is also shown that in many cases no reduction is possible.',

	{'abstract': u'For every natural number k we introduce the notion of k-th order convolution of functions on abelian groups. We study the group of convolution preserving automorphisms of function algebras in the limit. It turns out that such groups have k-nilpotent factor groups explaining why k-th order Fourier analysis has non-commutative features. To demonstrate our method in the quadratic case we develop a new quadratic representation theory on finite abelian groups. We introduce the notion of a quadrtic nil-morphism of an abelian group into a two step nil-manifold. We prove a structure theorem saying that any bounded function on a finite abelian group is decomposable into a structured part (which is the composition of a nil-morphism with a bounded complexity continuous function) and a random looking part with small U3 norm. It implies a new inverse theorem for the U3 norm. (The general case for Un, n&gt;3 will be discussed in the next part of this sequence.) We point out that our framework creates interesting limit objects for functions on finite (or compact) abelian groups that are measurable functions on nil-manifolds.',

	{'abstract': u'The N-dependence of the non-relativistic bosonic ground state energy is studied for quantum N-body systems with either Coulomb or Newton interactions. The Coulomb systems are "bosonic atoms," with their nucleus fixed, and the Newton systems are "bosonic stars". In either case there exists some third order polynomial in N such that the ratio of the ground state energy to the respective polynomial grows monotonically in N. Some applications of these new monotonicity results are discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses weight optimization problem in distributed consensus averaging algorithm over networks with symmetric star topology. We have determined optimal weights and convergence rate of the network in terms of its topological parameters. In addition, two alternative topologies with more rapid convergence rates have been introduced. The new topologies are Complete-Cored Symmetric (CCS) star and K-Cored Symmetric (KCS) star topologies. It has been shown that the optimal weights for the edges of central part in symmetric and CCS star configurations are independent of their branches. By simulation optimality of obtained weights under quantization constraints have been verified.',

	{'abstract': u'Vershik and Kerov conjectured in 1985 that dimensions of irreducible representations of finite symmetric groups, after appropriate normalization, converge to a constant with respect to the Plancherel family of measures on the space of Young diagrams. The statement of the Vershik-Kerov conjecture can be seen as an analogue of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem for the non-stationary Markov process of the growth of a Young diagram. The limiting constant is then interpreted as the entropy of the Plancherel measure. The main result of the paper is the proof of the Vershik-Kerov conjecture. The argument is based on the methods of Borodin, Okounkov and Olshanski.',

	{'abstract': u'The capacity region of multi-pair bidirectional relay networks, in which a relay node facilitates the communication between multiple pairs of users, is studied. This problem is first examined in the context of the linear shift deterministic channel model. The capacity region of this network when the relay is operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex mode for arbitrary number of pairs is characterized. It is shown that the cut-set upper-bound is tight and the capacity region is achieved by a so called divide-and-conquer relaying strategy. The insights gained from the deterministic network are then used for the Gaussian bidirectional relay network. The strategy in the deterministic channel translates to a specific superposition of lattice codes and random Gaussian codes at the source nodes and successive interference cancelation at the receiving nodes for the Gaussian network. The achievable rate of this scheme with two pairs is analyzed and it is shown that for all channel gains it achieves to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user of the cut-set upper-bound. Hence, the capacity region of the two-pair bidirectional Gaussian relay network to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user is characterized.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that the theory of hyperrings, due to M. Krasner, supplies a perfect framework to understand the algebraic structure of the adele class space of a global field. After promoting F1 to a hyperfield K, we prove that a hyperring of the form R/G (where R is a ring and G is a subgroup of its multiplicative group) is a hyperring extension of K if and only if G union 0 is a subfield of R. This result applies to the adele class space which thus inherits the structure of a hyperring extension H of K. We begin to investigate the content of an algebraic geometry over K. The category of commutative hyperring extensions of K is inclusive of: commutative algebras over fields with semi-linear homomorphisms, abelian groups with injective homomorphisms and a rather exotic land comprising homogeneous non-Desarguesian planes. Finally, we show that for a global field of positive characteristic, the groupoid of the prime elements of the hyperring H is canonically and equivariantly isomorphic to the groupoid of the loops of the maximal abelian cover of the curve associated to the global field.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a technique for derivation of a priori bounds for Gevrey-Sobolev norms of space-periodic three-dimensional solutions to evolutionary partial differential equations of hydrodynamic type. It involves a transformation of the flow velocity in the Fourier space, which introduces a feedback between the index of the norm and the norm of the transformed solution, and results in emergence of a mildly dissipative term. To illustrate the technique, we derive finite-time bounds for Gevrey-Sobolev norms of solutions to the Euler and inviscid Burgers equations, and global in time bounds for the Voigt-type regularisations of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equation (assuming that the respective norm of the initial condition is bounded). The boundedness of the norms implies analyticity of the solutions in space.',

	{'abstract': u'A gain graph is a graph whose edges are labelled invertibly by "gains" from a group. "Switching" is a transformation of gain graphs that generalizes conjugation in a group. A "weak chromatic function" of gain graphs with gains in a fixed group satisfies three laws: deletion-contraction for links with neutral gain, invariance under switching, and nullity on graphs with a neutral loop. The laws lead to the "weak chromatic group" of gain graphs, which is the universal domain for weak chromatic functions. We find expressions, valid in that group, for a gain graph in terms of minors without neutral-gain edges, or with added complete neutral-gain subgraphs, that generalize the expression of an ordinary chromatic polynomial in terms of monomials or falling factorials. These expressions imply relations for chromatic functions of gain graphs. We apply our relations to some special integral gain graphs including those that correspond to the Shi, Linial, and Catalan arrangements, thereby obtaining new evaluations of and new ways to calculate the zero-free chromatic polynomial and the integral and modular chromatic functions of these gain graphs, hence the characteristic polynomials and hypercubical lattice-point counting functions of the arrangements. We also calculate the total chromatic polynomial of any gain graph and especially of the Catalan, Shi, and Linial gain graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We give a spinorial characterization of isometrically immersed surfaces of arbitrary signature into 3-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space forms. For Lorentzian surfaces, this generalizes a recent work of the first author in to other Lorentzian space forms. We also characterize immersions of Riemannian surfaces in these spaces. From this we can deduce analogous results for timelike immersions of Lorentzian surfaces in space forms of corresponding signature, as well as for spacelike and timelike immersions of surfaces of signature (0,2), hence achieving a complete spinorial description for this class of pseudo-Riemannian immersions.',

	{'abstract': u"We improve the existing achievable rate regions for causal and for zero-delay source coding of stationary Gaussian sources under an average mean squared error (MSE) distortion measure. To begin with, we find a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic causal rate-distortion function (RDF) under such distortion measure, denoted by , for first-order Gauss-Markov processes. Rc^(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) by any causal source code, namely Rc^(D). We show that, for Gaussian sources, the latter can also be upper bounded as Rc^(D) leq Rc^(D) + 0.5 log_(2 pi e) bits/sample. In order to analyze for arbitrary zero-mean Gaussian stationary sources, we introduce bar(D), the information-theoretic causal RDF when the reconstruction error is jointly stationary with the source. Based upon bar(D), we derive three closed-form upper bounds to the additive rate loss defined as bar(D) - R(D), where R(D) denotes Shannon's RDF. Two of these bounds are strictly smaller than 0.5 bits/sample at all rates. These bounds differ from one another in their tightness and ease of evaluation; the tighter the bound, the more involved its evaluation. We then show that, for any source spectral density and any positive distortion D leq sigma_^, bar(D) can be realized by an AWGN channel surrounded by a unique set of causal pre-, post-, and feedback filters. We show that finding such filters constitutes a convex optimization problem. In order to solve the latter, we propose an iterative optimization procedure that yields the optimal filters and is guaranteed to converge to bar(D). Finally, by establishing a connection to feedback quantization we design a causal and a zero-delay coding scheme which, for Gaussian sources, achieves...",

	{'abstract': u'R is called a right WV -ring if each simple right R-module is injective relative to proper cyclics. If R is a right WV -ring, then R is right uniform or a right V -ring. It is shown that for a right WV-ring R, R is right noetherian if and only if each right cyclic module is a direct sum of a projective module and a CS or noetherian module. For a finitely generated module M with projective socle over a V -ring R such that every subfactor of M is a direct sum of a projective module and a CS or noetherian module, we show M = X oplus T, where X is semisimple and T is noetherian with zero socle. In the case that M = R, we get R = S oplus T, where S is a semisimple artinian ring, and T is a direct sum of right noetherian simple rings with zero socle. In addition, if R is a von Neumann regular ring, then it is semisimple artinian.',

	{'abstract': u'We prove a measure-theoretic identity that underlies all transient fluctuation theorems (TFTs) for entropy production and dissipated work in inhomogeneous deterministic and stochastic processes, including those of Evans and Searles, Crooks, and Seifert. The identity is used to deduce a tautological physical interpretation of TFTs in terms of the arrow of time, and its generality reveals that the self-inverse nature of the various trajectory and process transformations historically relied upon to prove TFTs, while necessary for these theorems from a physical standpoint, is not necessary from a mathematical one. The moment generating functions of thermodynamic variables appearing in the identity are shown to converge in general only in a vertical strip in the complex plane, with the consequence that a TFT that holds over arbitrary timescales may fail to give rise to an asymptotic fluctuation theorem for any possible speed of the corresponding large deviation principle. The case of strongly biased birth-death chains is presented to illustrate this phenomenon. We also discuss insights obtained from our measure-theoretic formalism into the results of Saha et. al. on the breakdown of TFTs for driven Brownian particles.',

	{'abstract': u'It is known that the capacity of parallel (e.g., multi-carrier) Gaussian point-to-point, multiple access and broadcast channels can be achieved by separate encoding for each subchannel (carrier) subject to a power allocation across carriers. Recent results have shown that parallel interference channels are not separable, i.e., joint coding is needed to achieve capacity in general. This work studies the separability, from a sum-capacity perspective, of single hop Gaussian interference networks with independent messages and arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers. The main result is that the only network that is always (for all values of channel coefficients) separable from a sum-capacity perspective is the MAC-Z-BC network, i.e., a network where a MAC component and a BC component are linked by a Z component. The sum capacity of this network is explicitly characterized.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the recovery of a nonnegative vector x from measurements y = Ax, where A is an m-by-n matrix whos entries are in . We establish that when A corresponds to the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph with sufficient expansion, a simple message-passing algorithm produces an estimate hat of x satisfying ||x- hat||_1 leq O(n/k) ||x-x(k)||_1, where x(k) is the best k-sparse approximation of x. The algorithm performs O(n (log(n/k))^2 log(k)) computation in total, and the number of measurements required is m = O(k log(n/k)). In the special case when x is k-sparse, the algorithm recovers x exactly in time O(n log(n/k) log(k)). Ultimately, this work is a further step in the direction of more formally developing the broader role of message-passing algorithms in solving compressed sensing problems.',

	{'abstract': u'We use contact fiber sums of open book decompositions to define an infinite hierarchy of filling obstructions for contact 3-manifolds, called planar k-torsion for nonnegative integers k, all of which cause the contact invariant in Embedded Contact Homology to vanish. Planar 0-torsion is equivalent to overtwistedness, while every contact manifold with Giroux torsion also has planar 1-torsion, and we give examples of contact manifolds that have planar k-torsion for any but no Giroux torsion, leading to many new examples of nonfillable contact manifolds. We show also that the complement of the binding of a supporting open book never has planar torsion. The technical basis of these results is an existence and uniqueness theorem for J-holomorphic curves with positive ends approaching the (possibly blown up) binding of an ensemble of open book decompositions.',

Our implementation is an improvement to Pollard\'s Kangaroo method in infrastructures, using distribution results of class numbers as well as information on the congruence class of the divisor class number, and an adaptation that efficiently navigates these torus-shaped infrastructures. Moreover, this is the first time that an efficient "square-root" algorithm has been applied to the infrastructure of a global field of unit rank 2.

	{'abstract': u"Subject to a range of side conditions, the two weight inequality for the Hilbert transform is characterized in terms of (1) a Poisson A_2 condition on the weights (2) A forward testing condition, in which the two weight inequality is tested on intervals (3) and a backwards testing condition, dual to (2). A critical new concept in the proof is an Energy Condition, which incorporates information about the distribution of the weights in question inside intervals. This condition is a consequence of the three conditions above. The Side Conditions are termed 'Energy Hypotheses'. At one endpoint they are necessary for the two weight inequality, and at the other, they are the Pivotal Conditions of Nazarov-Treil-Volberg. This new concept is combined with a known proof strategy devised by Nazarov-Treil-Volberg. A counterexample shows that the Pivotal Condition are not necessary for the two weight inequality.",

	{'abstract': u'In this study, we are concerned with introducing Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for a class of dynamic linear Hamiltonian nabla systems over a half-line on Sturmian time scales. After developing fundamental properties of solutions and regular spectral problems, we introduce the corresponding maximal and minimal operators for the system. Matrix disks are constructed and proved to be nested and converge to a limiting set. Some precise relationships among the rank of the matrix radius of the limiting set, the number of linearly independent square summable solutions, and the defect indices of the minimal operator are established. Using the above results, a classification of singular dynamic linear Hamiltonian nabla systems is given in terms of the defect indices of the minimal operator, and several equivalent conditions on the cases of limit point and limit circle are obtained, respectively. These results unify and extend certain classic and recent results on the subject in the continuous and discrete cases, respectively, to Sturmian time scales.',

	{'abstract': u'The classical matrix-tree theorem relates the determinant of the combinatorial Laplacian on a graph to the number of spanning trees. We generalize this result to Laplacians on one- and two-dimensional vector bundles, giving a combinatorial interpretation of their determinants in terms of so-called cycle rooted spanning forests (CRSFs). We construct natural measures on CRSFs for which the edges form a determinantal process. This theory gives a natural generalization of the spanning tree process adapted to graphs embedded on surfaces. We give a number of other applications, for example, we compute the probability that a loop-erased random walk on a planar graph between two vertices on the outer boundary passes left of two given faces. This probability cannot be computed using the standard Laplacian alone.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the problem of finding an explicit description of a developable narrow Moebius strip of minimal bending energy, which was first formulated by M. Sadowsky in 1930, we will develop the theory of elastic strips. Recently E.L. Starostin and G.H.M. van der Heijden found a numerical description for an elastic Moebius strip, but did not give an integrable solution. We derive two conservation laws, which describe the equilibrium equations of elastic strips. In applying these laws we find two new classes of integrable elastic strips which correspond to spherical elastic curves. We establish a connection between Hopf tori and force--free strips, which are defined by one of the integrable strips, we have found. We introduce the P--functional and relate it to elastic strips.',

A concept of self-adjointness of the boundary conditions is introduced. The self-adjointness of the corresponding dynamic operator is discussed on a suitable admissible function space, and fundamental spectral results are obtained. The dual orthogonality of eigenfunctions is shown in a special case. Extensions to even-order Sturm-Liouville dynamic equations, linear Hamiltonian and symplectic nabla systems on general time scales are also discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies composite quantum systems, like atom-cavity systems and coupled optical resonators, in the absence of external driving by resorting to methods from quantum field theory. Going beyond the rotating wave approximation, it is shown that the usually neglected counter-rotating part of the Hamiltonian relates to the entropy operator and generates an irreversible time evolution. The vacuum state of the system is shown to evolve into a generalized coherent state exhibiting entanglement of the modes in which the counter-rotating terms are expressed. Possible consequences at observational level in quantum optics experiments are currently under study.',

	{'abstract': u'A methodology to analyze the properties of the first (largest) eigenvalue and its eigenvector is developed for large symmetric random sparse matrices utilizing the cavity method of statistical mechanics. Under a tree approximation, which is plausible for infinitely large systems, in conjunction with the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier for constraining the length of the eigenvector, the eigenvalue problem is reduced to a bunch of optimization problems of a quadratic function of a single variable, and the coefficients of the first and the second order terms of the functions act as cavity fields that are handled in cavity analysis. We show that the first eigenvalue is determined in such a way that the distribution of the cavity fields has a finite value for the second order moment with respect to the cavity fields of the first order coefficient. The validity and utility of the developed methodology are examined by applying it to two analytically solvable and one simple but non-trivial examples in conjunction with numerical justification.',

Recent advances in the field of large dimensional random matrix theory are used that result in a simple and computationally efficient consistent estimator of the power of each source. A criterion to determine the minimum number of sensors and the minimum number of samples required to achieve source separation is then introduced. Simulations are performed that corroborate the theoretical claims and show that the proposed power estimator largely outperforms alternative power inference techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, Cappell and Miller extended the classical construction of the analytic torsion for de Rham complexes to coupling with an arbitrary flat bundle and the holomorphic torsion for -complexes to coupling with an arbitrary holomorphic bundle with compatible connection of type . Cappell and Miller studied the properties of these torsions, including the behavior under metric deformations. On the other hand, Mathai and Wu generalized the classical construction of the analytic torsion to the twisted de Rham complexes with an odd degree closed form as a flux and later, more generally, to the -graded elliptic complexes. Mathai and Wu also studied the properties of analytic torsions for the -graded elliptic complexes, including the behavior under metric and flux deformations. In this paper we define the Cappell-Miller holomorphic torsion for the twisted Dolbeault-type complexes and the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion for the twisted de Rham complexes. We obtain variation formulas for the twisted Cappell-Miller holomorphic and analytic torsions under metric and flux deformations.',

	{'abstract': u"A method to construct girth-12 (3,L) quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes with all lengths larger than a certain given number is proposed, via a given girth-12 code subjected to some constraints. The lengths of these codes can be arbitrary integers of the form LP, provided that P is larger than a tight lower bound determined by the maximal element within the exponent matrix of the given girth-12 code. By applying the method to the case of row-weight six, we obtained a family of girth-12 (3,6) QC-LDPC codes for arbitrary lengths above 2688, which includes 30 member codes with shorter code lengths compared with the shortest girth-12 (3,6) QC-LDPC codes reported by O'Sullivan.",

	{'abstract': u'Provable lower bounds are presented for the information rate I(X; X+S+N) where X is the symbol drawn from a fixed, finite-size alphabet, S a discrete-valued random variable (RV) and N a Gaussian RV. The information rate I(X; X+S+N) serves as a tight lower bound for capacity of intersymbol interference (ISI) channels corrupted by Gaussian noise. The new bounds can be calculated with a reasonable computational load and provide a similar level of tightness as the well-known conjectured lower bound by Shamai and Laroia for a good range of finite-ISI channels of practical interest. The computation of the presented bounds requires the evaluation of the magnitude sum of the precursor ISI terms as well as the identification of dominant terms among them seen at the output of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) decision feedback equalizer (DFE).',

	{'abstract': u'This is the third article in a series of three papers on the resonance energy levels of anharmonic oscillators. Whereas the first two papers mainly dealt with double-well potentials and modifications thereof [see J. Zinn-Justin and U. D. Jentschura, Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 313 (2004), pp. 197 and 269], we here focus on simple even and odd anharmonic oscillators for arbitrary magnitude and complex phase of the coupling parameter. A unification is achieved by the use of PT-symmetry inspired dispersion relations and generalized quantization conditions that include instanton configurations. Higher-order formulas are provided for the oscillators of degrees 3 to 8, which lead to subleading corrections to the leading factorial growth of the perturbative coefficients describing the resonance energies. Numerical results are provided, and higher-order terms are found to be numerically significant. The resonances are described by generalized expansions involving intertwined non-analytic exponentials, logarithmic terms and power series. Finally, we summarize spectral properties and dispersion relations of anharmonic oscillators, and their interconnections. The purpose is to look at one of the classic problems of quantum theory from a new perspective, through which we gain systematic access to the phenomenologically significant higher-order terms.',

We refer to this setup as 2DMBC. We define the secret-key capacity in the 2DMBC setup and prove lower and upper bounds on this capacity.

	{'abstract': u'We provide a novel upper-bound on Witsenhausen\'s rate, the rate required in the zero-error analogue of the Slepian-Wolf problem; our bound is given in terms of a new information-theoretic functional defined on a certain graph. We then use the functional to give a single letter lower-bound on the error exponent for the Slepian-Wolf problem under the vanishing error probability criterion, where the decoder has full (i.e. unencoded) side information. Our exponent stems from our new encoding scheme which makes use of source distribution only through the positions of the zeros in the `channel\' matrix connecting the source with the side information, and in this sense is `semi-universal\'. We demonstrate that our error exponent can beat the `expurgated\' source-coding exponent of Csisz \'r and K "rner, achievability of which requires the use of a non-universal maximum-likelihood decoder. An extension of our scheme to the lossy case (i.e. Wyner-Ziv) is given. For the case when the side information is a deterministic function of the source, the exponent of our improved scheme agrees with the sphere-packing bound exactly (thus determining the reliability function). An application of our functional to zero-error channel capacity is also given.',

This approach was proved to be a rigorous limit of the network equations in a general setting, and we express here the results in a more customary and simpler framework. We propose a heuristic argument to derive these equations providing a more intuitive understanding of their origin. These equations are characterized by a strong coupling between the different moments of the solutions. We analyse the equations, present an algorithm to simulate the solutions of these mean-field equations, and investigate numerically the equations. In particular, we build a bridge between these equations and Sompolinsky and collaborators approach (1988, 1990), and show how the coupling between the mean and the covariance function deviates from customary approaches.',

	{'abstract': u'Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians are Lagrangian submanifolds that are critical points of the volume functional under Hamiltonian deformations. They can be considered as a generalization of special Lagrangians or Lagrangian and minimal submanifolds. Joyce, Schoen and the author show that given any compact rigid Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian in , one can always find a family of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians of the same type in any compact symplectic manifolds with a compatible metric. The advantage of this result is that it holds in very general classes. But the disadvantage is that we do not know where these examples locate and examples in this family might be far apart. In this paper, we derive a local condition on Kahler manifolds which ensures the existence of one family of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian tori near a point with given frame satisfying the criterion. Butscher and Corvino ever proposed a condition in n=2. But our condition appears to be different from theirs. The condition derived in this paper not only works for any dimension, but also for the Clifford torus case which is not covered by their condition.',

Some versions of these games have been motivated by research in complexity theory and have ties to well-known research problems in coding theory, and some variations have led to interesting new research. In this paper, we review Ebert\'s Hat Game, which garnered a considerable amount of publicity in the late 90\'s and early 00\'s, and the Hats-on-a-line Game. Then we introduce a new hat game which is a "hybrid" of these two games and provide an optimal strategy for playing the new game. The optimal strategy is quite simple, but the proof involves an interesting combinatorial argument.',

	{'abstract': u'In operator algebra theory, a conditional expectation is usually assumed to be a projection map onto a sub-algebra. In the paper, a further type of conditional expectation and an extension of the Lueders - von Neumann measurement to observables with continuous spectra are considered; both are defined for a single operator and become a projection map only if they exist for all operators. Criteria for the existence of the different types of conditional expectation and of the extension of the Lueders - von Neumann measurement are presented, and the question whether they coincide is studied. All this is done in the general framework of Jordan operator algebras. The examples considered include the type I and type II operator algebras, the standard Hilbert space model of quantum mechanics, and a no-go result concerning the conditional expectation of observables that satisfy the canonical commutator relation.',

	{'abstract': u'An extension of the conditional expectations (those under a given subalgebra of events and not the simple ones under a single event) from the classical to the quantum case is presented. In the classical case, the conditional expectations always exist; in the quantum case, however, they exist only if a certain weak compatibility criterion is satisfied. This compatibility criterion was introduced among others in a recent paper by the author. Then, state-independent conditional expectations and quantum Markov processes are studied. A classical Markov process is a probability measure, together with a system of random variables, satisfying the Markov property and can equivalently be described by a system of Markovian kernels (often forming a semigroup). This equivalence is partly extended to quantum probabilities. It is shown that a dynamical (semi)group can be derived from a given system of quantum observables satisfying the Markov property, and the group generators are studied. The results are presented in the framework of Jordan operator algebras, and a very general type of observables (including the usual real-valued observables or self-adjoint operators) is considered.',

The algorithm has an application in the context of curve based cryptography. One distinguished property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends quasi-quadratically on the degree of the finite base field. Our algorithm is a modified version of an earlier method that was developed in joint work with Lubicz. We explain how one can alter the original algorithm, on the basis of new theory, such that it can be used to efficiently count points on genus two curves over large finite fields. Examples of cryptographic size have been computed using an experimental Magma implementation of the algorithm which has been programmed by the author. Our computational results show that the quasi-quadratic algorithm of Lubicz and the author, with some improvements, is practical and relevant for cryptography.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a simple technique to compute moments of derivatives of unitary characteristic polynomials. The first part of the technique relies on an idea of Bump and Gamburd: it uses orthonormality of Schur functions over unitary groups to compute matrix averages of characteristic polynomials. In order to consider derivatives of those polynomials, we here need the added strength of the Generalized Binomial Theorem of Okounkov and Olshanski. This result is very natural as it provides coefficients for the Taylor expansions of Schur functions, in terms of shifted Schur functions. The answer is finally given as a sum over partitions of functions of the contents. One can also obtain alternative expressions involving hypergeometric functions of matrix arguments.',

	{'abstract': u'The Jordan algebra structure of the bounded real quantum observables was recognized already in the early days of quantum mechanics. While there are plausible reasons for most parts of this structure, the existence of the distributive nonassociative multiplication operation is hard to justify from a physical or statistical point of view. Considering the non-Boolean extension of classical probabilities, presented in a recent paper, it is shown in this paper that such a multiplication operation can be derived from certain properties of the conditional probabilities and the observables, i.e., from postulates with a clear statistical interpretation. The well-known close relation between Jordan operator algebras and C*-algebras then provides the connection to the quantum-mechanical Hilbert space formalism, thus resulting in a novel axiomatic approach to general quantum mechanics that includes the types II and III von Neumann algebras.',

	{'abstract': u'The so-called "replica method" of statistical physics is employed for the large system analysis of vector precoding for the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. The transmitter is assumed to comprise a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, that minimizes the front-end imposed transmit energy penalty. Focusing on discrete complex input alphabets, the energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet to a larger alphabet set prior to precoding. For the common discrete lattice-based relaxation, the problem is found to violate the assumption of replica symmetry and a replica symmetry breaking ansatz is taken. The limiting empirical distribution of the precoder\'s output, as well as the limiting energy penalty, are derived for one-step replica symmetry breaking. For convex relaxations, replica symmetry is found to hold and corresponding results are obtained for comparison. Particularizing to a "zero-forcing" (ZF) linear front-end, and non-cooperative users, a decoupling result is derived according to which the channel observed by each of the individual receivers can be effectively characterized by the Markov chain u-x-y, where u, x, and y are the channel input, the equivalent precoder output, and the channel output, respectively. For discrete lattice-based alphabet relaxation, the impact of replica symmetry breaking is demonstrated for the energy penalty at the transmitter. An analysis of spectral efficiency is provided to compare discrete lattice-based relaxations against convex relaxations, as well as linear ZF and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Focusing on quaternary phase shift-keying (QPSK), significant performance gains of both lattice and convex relaxations are revealed compared to linear ZF precoding, for medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). THP is shown to be outperformed as well.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper studies decentralized, Fountain and network-coding based strategies for facilitating data collection in circular wireless sensor networks, which rely on the stochastic diversity of data storage. The goal is to allow for a reduced delay collection by a data collector who accesses the network at a random position and random time. Data dissemination is performed by a set of relays which form a circular route to exchange source packets. The storage nodes within the transmission range of the route's relays linearly combine and store overheard relay transmissions using random decentralized strategies. An intelligent data collector first collects a minimum set of coded packets from a subset of storage nodes in its proximity, which might be sufficient for recovering the original packets and, by using a message-passing decoder, attempts recovering all original source packets from this set. Whenever the decoder stalls, the source packet which restarts decoding is polled/doped from its original source node. The random-walk-based analysis of the decoding/doping process furnishes the collection delay analysis with a prediction on the number of required doped packets. The number of doped packets can be surprisingly small when employed with an Ideal Soliton code degree distribution and, hence, the doping strategy may have the least collection delay when the density of source nodes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we demonstrate that network coding makes dissemination more efficient at the expense of a larger collection delay. Not surprisingly, a circular network allows for a significantly more (analytically and otherwise) tractable strategies relative to a network whose model is a random geometric graph.",

	{'abstract': u"We shall show how to decompose, by functorial and canonical fibrations, arbitrary -dimensional complex projective varieties into varieties (or rather ` geometric orbifolds rq of one of the three pure geometries determined by the `sign' (negative, zero, or positive) of the canonical bundle. These decompositions being birationally invariant, birational versions of these pure geometries, based on the canonical (or ` Kodaira rq dimension will be considered, rather. A crucial feature of these decompositions is indeed that, in order to deal with multiple fibres of fibrations, they need to take place in the larger category of `geometric orbifolds' . These are `virtual ramified covers' of varieties, which `virtually eliminate' multiple fibres of fibrations. Although formally the same as the `pairs' of the LMMP (see cite, cite, cite and the references there), they are here fully geometric objects equipped with the usual geometric invariants of varieties, such as sheaves of (symmetric) differential forms, fundamental group, Kobayashi pseudometric, integral points, morphisms and rational maps.

	{'abstract': u'Due to hardware and computational constraints, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) normally do not take measurements of time-of-arrival or time-difference-of-arrival for rangebased localization. Instead, WSNs in some applications use rangefree localization for simple but less accurate determination of sensor positions. A well-known algorithm for this purpose is the centroid algorithm. This paper presents a range-free localization technique based on the radical line of intersecting circles. This technique provides greater accuracy than the centroid algorithm, at the expense of a slight increase in computational load. Simulation results show that for the scenarios studied, the radical line method can give an approximately 2 to 30% increase in accuracy over the centroid algorithm, depending on whether or not the anchors have identical ranges, and on the value of DOI.',

At each step, with equal probability, either we pick a ball at random in and place it in , or vice-versa (provided of course that , or , is not empty). The number of balls in after steps is of order , and this number remains essentially the same after further steps. Observe that each ball in the urn after steps has a probability bounded away from and to be placed back in the urn after further steps. So, even though the number of balls in does not evolve significantly between and , the precise contain of urn does. This elementary observation is the source of an interesting two-time-scale phenomenon which we illustrate using a simple model of fragmentation-coagulation. Inspired by Pitman's construction of coalescing random forests, we consider for every a uniform random tree with vertices, and at each step, depending on the outcome of an independent fair coin tossing, either we remove one edge chosen uniformly at random amongst the remaining edges, or we replace one edge chosen uniformly at random amongst the edges which have been removed previously. The process that records the sizes of the tree-components evolves by fragmentation and coagulation.

	{'abstract': u'Wireless networks with multiple nodes that relay information from a source to a destination are expected to be deployed in many applications. Therefore, understanding their design and performance under practical constraints is important. In this work, we propose and study three multihopping decode and forward (MDF) protocols for multistage half-duplex relay networks with no direct link between the source and destination nodes. In all three protocols, we assume no cooperation across relay nodes for encoding and decoding. Numerical evaluation in illustrative example networks and comparison with cheap relay cut-set bounds for half-duplex networks show that the proposed MDF protocols approach capacity in some ranges of channel gains. The main idea in the design of the protocols is the use of coding in interference networks that are created in different states or modes of a half-duplex network. Our results suggest that multistage half-duplex relaying with practical constraints on cooperation is comparable to point-to-point links and full-duplex relay networks, if there are multiple non-overlapping paths from source to destination and if suitable coding is employed in interference network states.',

	{'abstract': u'A half-duplex wireless network with 6 lateral nodes, 3 transmitters and 3 receivers, and a central relay is considered. The transmitters wish to send information to their corresponding receivers via a two phase communication protocol. The receivers decode their desired messages by using side information and the signals received from the relay. We derive an outer bound on the capacity region of any two phase protocol as well as 3 achievable regions by employing different relaying strategies. In particular, we combine physical and network layer coding to take advantage of the interference at the relay, using, for example, lattice-based codes. We then specialize our results to the exchange rate. It is shown that for any snr, we can achieve within 0.5 bit of the upper bound by lattice coding and within 0.34 bit, if we take the best of the 3 strategies. Also, for high snr, lattice coding is within log(3)/4 ~ 0.4 bit of the upper bound.',

	{'abstract': u'Information-theoretic security -- widely accepted as the strictest notion of security -- relies on channel coding techniques that exploit the inherent randomness of the propagation channels to significantly strengthen the security of digital communications systems. Motivated by recent developments in the field, this paper aims at a characterization of the fundamental secrecy limits of wireless networks. Based on a general model in which legitimate nodes and potential eavesdroppers are randomly scattered in space, the intrinsically secure communications graph (iS-graph) is defined from the point of view of information-theoretic security. Conclusive results are provided for the local connectivity of the Poisson iS-graph, in terms of node degrees and isolation probabilities. It is shown how the secure connectivity of the network varies with the wireless propagation effects, the secrecy rate threshold of each link, and the noise powers of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers. Sectorized transmission and eavesdropper neutralization are explored as viable strategies for improving the secure connectivity. Lastly, the maximum secrecy rate between a node and each of its neighbours is characterized, and the case of colluding eavesdroppers is studied. The results help clarify how the spatial density of eavesdroppers can compromise the intrinsic security of wireless networks.',

A sequence of real numbers indexed by words in non-commuting variables with values invariant under cyclic permutations of the indexes, is called a tracial sequence. We prove that such a sequence can be represented with tracial moments of matrices if its corresponding moment matrix is positive semidefinite and of finite rank. A truncated tracial sequence allows for such a representation if and only if one of its extensions admits a flat extension. Finally, we apply the theory via duality to investigate trace-positive polynomials in non-commuting variables.',

Trees in this class can be generated by substitution processes. Their spectra are shown to be purely absolutely continuous and to consist of finitely many bands. The main result gives stability of absolutely continuous spectrum under sufficiently small radially label symmetric perturbations for non regular trees in this class. In sharp contrast, the absolutely continuous spectrum can be completely destroyed by arbitrary small radially label symmetric perturbations for regular trees in this class.',

	{'abstract': u"Using Hermite's formulation of polynomial stability conditions, static output feedback (SOF) controller design can be formulated as a polynomial matrix inequality (PMI), a (generally nonconvex) nonlinear semidefinite programming problem that can be solved (locally) with PENNON, an implementation of a penalty method. Typically, Hermite SOF PMI problems are badly scaled and experiments reveal that this has a negative impact on the overall performance of the solver. In this note we recall the algebraic interpretation of Hermite's quadratic form as a particular Bezoutian and we use results on polynomial interpolation to express the Hermite PMI in a Lagrange polynomial basis, as an alternative to the conventional power basis. Numerical experiments on benchmark problem instances show the substantial improvement brought by the approach, in terms of problem scaling, number of iterations and convergence behavior of PENNON.",

	{'abstract': u"Let Q be a finite quiver without oriented cycles, let Lambda be the associated preprojective algebra, let g be the associated Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Weyl group W, and let n be the positive part of g. For each Weyl group element w, a subcategory C_w of mod( Lambda) was introduced by Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Scott. It is known that C_w is a Frobenius category and that its stable category is a Calabi-Yau category of dimension two. We show that C_w yields a cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring CC[N(w)] of the unipotent group N(w) := N cap (w^N_-w). Here N is the pro-unipotent pro-group with Lie algebra the completion of n. One can identify CC[N(w)] with a subalgebra of the graded dual of the universal enveloping algebra U(n) of n. Let S^* be the dual of Lusztig's semicanonical basis S of U(n). We show that all cluster monomials of CC[N(w)] belong to S^*, and that S^* cap CC[N(w)] is a basis of CC[N(w)]. Moreover, we show that the cluster algebra obtained from CC[N(w)] by formally inverting the generators of the coefficient ring is isomorphic to the algebra CC[N^w] of regular functions on the unipotent cell N^w := N cap (B_-wB_-) of the Kac-Moody group G with Lie algebra g. We obtain a corresponding dual semicanonical basis of CC[N^w]. As one application we obtain a basis for each acyclic cluster algebra, which contains all cluster monomials in a natural way.",
