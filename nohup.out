	{'abstract': u'We prove that a Ricci curvature based method of triangulation of compact Riemannian manifolds, due to Grove and Petersen, extends to the context of weighted Riemannian manifolds and more general metric measure spaces. In both cases the role of the lower bound on Ricci curvature is replaced by the curvature-dimension condition . We show also that for weighted Riemannian manifolds the triangulation can be improved to become a thick one and that, in consequence, such manifolds admit weight-sensitive quasimeromorphic mappings. An application of this last result to information manifolds is considered. Further more, we extend to weak spaces the results of Kanai regarding the discretization of manifolds, and show that the volume growth of such a space is the same as that of any of its discretizations.',

	{'abstract': u'The sensor network localization, SNL, problem in embedding dimension r, consists of locating the positions of wireless sensors, given only the distances between sensors that are within radio range and the positions of a subset of the sensors (called anchors). Current solution techniques relax this problem to a weighted, nearest, (positive) semidefinite programming, SDP, completion problem, by using the linear mapping between Euclidean distance matrices, EDM, and semidefinite matrices. The resulting SDP is solved using primal-dual interior point solvers, yielding an expensive and inexact solution. This relaxation is highly degenerate in the sense that the feasible set is restricted to a low dimensional face of the SDP cone, implying that the Slater constraint qualification fails. Cliques in the graph of the SNL problem give rise to this degeneracy in the SDP relaxation. In this paper, we take advantage of the absence of the Slater constraint qualification and derive a technique for the SNL problem, with exact data, that explicitly solves the corresponding rank restricted SDP problem. No SDP solvers are used. For randomly generated instances, we are able to efficiently solve many huge instances of this NP-hard problem to high accuracy, by finding a representation of the minimal face of the SDP cone that contains the SDP matrix representation of the EDM. The main work of our algorithm consists in repeatedly finding the intersection of subspaces that represent the faces of the SDP cone that correspond to cliques of the SNL problem.',

	{'abstract': u'A tame filtration of an algebra is defined by the growth of its terms, which has to be majorated by an exponential function. A particular case is the degree filtration used in the definition of the growth of finitely generated algebras. The notion of tame filtration is useful in the study of possible distortion of degrees of elements when one algebra is embedded as a subalgebra in another. A geometric analogue is the distortion of the (Riemannian) metric of a (Lie) subgroup when compared to the metric induced from the ambient (Lie) group. The distortion of a subalgebra in an algebra also reflects the degree of complexity of the membership problem for the elements of this algebra in this subalgebra. One of our goals here is to investigate, mostly in the case of associative or Lie algebras, if a tame filtration of an algebra can be induced from the degree filtration of a larger algebra.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work it is shown that certain interesting types of quasi-orthogonal system of subalgebras (whose existence cannot be ruled out by the trivial necessary conditions) cannot exist. In particular, it is proved that there is no quasi-orthogonal decomposition of M_n(C) otimes M_n(C) equiv M_(C) into a number of maximal abelian subalgebras and factors isomorphic to M_n(C) in which the number of factors would be 1 or 3. In addition, some new tools are introduced, too: for example, a quantity c(A,B), which measures "how close" the subalgebras A,B subset M_n(C) are to being quasi-orthogonal. It is shown that in the main cases of interest, c(A\',B\') - where A\' and B\' are the commutants of A and B, respectively - can be determined by c(A,B) and the dimensions of A and B. The corresponding formula is used to find some further obstructions regarding quasi-orthogonal systems.',

(1) We are given partial, and partly erroneous, knowledge of the signal\'s support, denoted by . (2) We are also given an erroneous estimate of the signal values on , denoted by . In practice, both these may be available from available prior knowledge. Alternatively, in recursive reconstruction applications, like real-time dynamic MRI, one can use the support estimate and the signal value estimate from the previous time instant as and . In this work, we introduce regularized modified-BPDN (reg-mod-BPDN) and obtain computable bounds on its reconstruction error. Reg-mod-BPDN tries to find the signal that is sparsest outside the set , while being "close enough" to on and while satisfying the data constraint. Corresponding results for modified-BPDN and BPDN follow as direct corollaries. A second key contribution is an approach to obtain computable error bounds that hold without any sufficient conditions. This makes it easy to compare the bounds for the various approaches. Empirical reconstruction error comparisons with many existing approaches are also provided.',

	{'abstract': u'Continuous models used in physics and other areas of mathematics applications become discrete when they are computerized, e.g., utilized for computations. Besides, computers are controlling processes in discrete spaces, such as films and television programs. At the same time, continuous models that are in the background of discrete representations use mathematical technology developed for continuous media. The most important example of such a technology is calculus, which is so useful in physics and other sciences. The main goal of this paper is to synthesize continuous features and powerful technology of the classical calculus with the discrete approach of numerical mathematics and computational physics. To do this, we further develop the theory of fuzzy continuous functions and apply this theory to functions defined on discrete sets. The main interest is the classical Intermediate Value theorem. Although the result of this theorem is completely based on continuity, utilization of a relaxed version of continuity called fuzzy continuity, allows us to prove discrete versions of the Intermediate Value theorem. This result provides foundations for a new approach to discrete dynamics.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose new semi-implicit numerical methods for the integration of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation with built-in angular momentum conservation. The performance of the proposed integrators is tested on the 1D Heisenberg chain. For this system, our schemes show better stability properties and allow us to use considerably larger time steps than standard explicit methods. At the same time, these semi-implicit schemes are also of comparable accuracy to and computationally much cheaper than the standard midpoint implicit method. The results are of key importance for atomistic spin dynamics simulations and the study of spin dynamics beyond the macro spin approximation.',

	{'abstract': u"We propose two nonlinear Kalman smoothers that rely on Student's t distributions. The T-Robust smoother finds the maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) solution for Gaussian process noise and Student's t observation noise, and is extremely robust against outliers, outperforming the recently proposed l1-Laplace smoother in extreme situations (e.g. 50% or more outliers). The second estimator, which we call the T-Trend smoother, is able to follow sudden changes in the process model, and is derived as a MAP solver for a model with Student's t-process noise and Gaussian observation noise. We design specialized methods to solve both problems which exploit the special structure of the Student's t-distribution, and provide a convergence theory. Both smoothers can be implemented with only minor modifications to an existing L2 smoother implementation. Numerical results for linear and nonlinear models illustrating both robust and fast tracking applications are presented.",

The free terms are nonlinear with Lipschitz continuous coefficients. Under suitable conditions on the covariance measure, Dalang and Sanz-Sol \'e [Memoirs of the AMS, Vol 199, 2009] have proved the existence of a random field solution with H "older continuous sample paths, jointly in both arguments, time and space. By perturbing the driving noise with a multiplicative parameter , a family of probability laws corresponding to the respective solutions to the equation is obtained. Using the weak convergence approach to large deviations developed in [P. Dupuis, R. S. Ellis, 1997], we prove that this family satisfies a Laplace principle in the H "older norm.',

By extending the parametrizations to quasisymmetries, we show that this semigroup is a quotient of the Teichmueller space of doubly-connected Riemann surfaces by a Z action. Furthermore, the semigroup can be given a complex structure in two distinct, natural ways.

If M&lt;=0, D(M) is embedded and it is called unduloid, if M&gt;0, D(M) is not embedded and it is called nodoid. These surfaces are called Delaunays and they are foliated by circles. The trace of the focus in the construction above is called the profile curve of the Delaunay and it is transversal to the circles. Another well known family of constant mean curvature surfaces are the Twizzlers, they are foliated by helices and we can naturally define a profile curve which is transversal to the helices. To make the presentation in this abstract easier, we will be only considering Twizzlers with mean curvature 1. In this paper we will prove that if we roll the profile curve of a Twizzler on a line in a plane and, simultaneously, we move the points in the line at the same speed, so that the rolling motion of the profile curve looks like if it were placed on a treadmill, then, the trace made by the origin of the profile curve is one of the closed heart-shaped curves HS(M,w)= for some M&gt;-1/4 and w&gt;0.

	{'abstract': u'We revisit the adaptive Lasso as well as the thresholded Lasso with refitting, in a high-dimensional linear model, and study prediction error, -error (), and number of false positive selections. Our theoretical results for the two methods are, at a rather fine scale, comparable. The differences only show up in terms of the (minimal) restricted and sparse eigenvalues, favoring thresholding over the adaptive Lasso. As regards prediction and estimation, the difference is virtually negligible, but our bound for the number of false positives is larger for the adaptive Lasso than for thresholding. Moreover, both these two-stage methods add value to the one-stage Lasso in the sense that, under appropriate restricted and sparse eigenvalue conditions, they have similar prediction and estimation error as the one-stage Lasso, but substantially less false positives.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a generic diffusion on the 1D torus and give a simple representation formula for the large deviation rate functional of its invariant probability measure, in the limit of vanishing noise. Previously, this rate functional had been characterized by M.I. Freidlin and A.D. Wentzell as solution of a rather complex optimization problem. We discuss this last problem in full generality and show that it leads to our formula. We express the rate functional by means of a geometric transformation that, with a Maxwell-like construction, creates flat regions. We then consider piecewise deterministic Markov processes on the 1D torus and show that the corresponding large deviation rate functional for the stationary distribution is obtained by applying the same transformation. Inspired by this, we prove a universality result showing that the transformation generates viscosity solution of stationary Hamilton--Jacobi equation associated to any Hamiltonian satisfying suitable weak conditions.',

We propose a message-passing based scheme for detecting correlated sources directly, with no need for source coding. The detection is done simultaneously over a block of transmitted binary symbols (word). Simulation results are provided demonstrating a substantial improvement in bit-error-rate in comparison with the unmodified detector and the alternative of source compression. The robustness of the error-performance improvement is shown under practical model settings, including wrong estimation of the generating Markov transition matrix and finite-length spreading codes.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the Linear Programming (LP) solution of the Compressed Sensing (CS) problem over reals, also known as the Basis Pursuit (BasP) algorithm. The BasP allows interpretation as a channel-coding problem, and it guarantees error-free reconstruction with a properly chosen measurement matrix and sufficiently sparse error vectors. In this manuscript, we examine how the BasP performs on a given measurement matrix and develop an algorithm to discover the sparsest vectors for which the BasP fails. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of our previous results on finding the most probable error-patterns degrading performance of a finite size Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code in the error-floor regime. The BasP fails when its output is different from the actual error-pattern. We design a CS-Instanton Search Algorithm (ISA) generating a sparse vector, called a CS-instanton, such that the BasP fails on the CS-instanton, while the BasP recovery is successful for any modification of the CS-instanton replacing a nonzero element by zero. We also prove that, given a sufficiently dense random input for the error-vector, the CS-ISA converges to an instanton in a small finite number of steps. The performance of the CS-ISA is illustrated on a randomly generated matrix. For this example, the CS-ISA outputs the shortest instanton (error vector) pattern of length 11.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we prove the existence of non-negative solutions for a non-local higher order degenerate parabolic equation arising in the modeling of hydraulic fractures. The equation is similar to the well-known thin film equation, but the Laplace operator is replaced by a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, corresponding to the square root of the Laplace operator on a bounded domain with Neumann boundary conditions (which can also be defined using the periodic Hilbert transform). In our study, we have to deal with the usual difficulty associated to higher order equations (e.g. lack of maximum principle). However, there are important differences with, for instance, the thin film equation: First, our equation is nonlocal; Also the natural energy estimate is not as good as in the case of the thin film equation, and does not yields, for instance, boundedness and continuity of the solutions (our case is critical in dimension in that respect).',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we obtain a new abstract formula relating eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator to two families of symmetric and skew-symmetric operators and their commutators. This formula generalizes earlier ones obtained by Harrell, Stubbe, Hook, Ashbaugh, Hermi, Levitin and Parnovski. We also show how one can use this abstract formulation both for giving dierent and simpler proofs for all the known results obtained for the eigenvalues of a power of the Laplace operator (i.e. the Dirichlet Laplacian, the clamped plate problem for the bilaplacian and more generally for the polyharmonic problem on a bounded Euclidean domain) and to obtain new ones. In a last paragraph, we derive new bounds for eigenvalues of any power of the Kohn Laplacian on the Heisenberg group.',

	{'abstract': u'Sigma-Delta modulation is a popular method for analog-to-digital conversion of bandlimited signals that employs coarse quantization coupled with oversampling. The standard mathematical model for the error analysis of the method measures the performance of a given scheme by the rate at which the associated reconstruction error decays as a function of the oversampling ratio . It was recently shown that exponential accuracy of the form can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma-Delta modulation schemes. By general information-entropy arguments must be less than 1. The current best known value for is approximately 0.088. The schemes that were designed to achieve this accuracy employ the "greedy" quantization rule coupled with feedback filters that fall into a class we call "minimally supported". In this paper, we study the minimization problem that corresponds to optimizing the error decay rate for this class of feedback filters. We solve a relaxed version of this problem exactly and provide explicit asymptotics of the solutions. From these relaxed solutions, we find asymptotically optimal solutions of the original problem, which improve the best known exponential error decay rate to . Our method draws from the theory of orthogonal polynomials; in particular, it relates the optimal filters to the zero sets of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.',

	{'abstract': u'Finding the sparse solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations has many applications, especially, it is used in Compressed Sensing (CS), Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), and sparse decomposition of signals on overcomplete dictionaries. We have recently proposed a fast algorithm, called Smoothed (SL0), for this task. Contrary to many other sparse recovery algorithms, SL0 is not based on minimizing the norm, but it tries to directly minimize the norm of the solution. The basic idea of SL0 is optimizing a sequence of certain (continuous) cost functions approximating the norm of a vector. However, in previous papers, we did not provide a complete convergence proof for SL0. In this paper, we study the convergence properties of SL0, and show that under a certain sparsity constraint in terms of Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP), and with a certain choice of parameters, the convergence of SL0 to the sparsest solution is guaranteed. Moreover, we study the complexity of SL0, and we show that whenever the dimension of the dictionary grows, the complexity of SL0 increases with the same order as Matching Pursuit (MP), which is one of the fastest existing sparse recovery methods, while contrary to MP, its convergence to the sparsest solution is guaranteed under certain conditions which are satisfied through the choice of parameters.',

We start by showing how MSG systems can be viewed as a general class of periodic functions. Next, periodic and step-like solutions of these systems are discussed in some details. In particular, we study the static properties of such systems by considering slope and phase diagrams. We also use concepts like energy density and pressure to characterize and distinguish such solutions. We interpret these solutions as an interacting many body system, in which kinks and antikinks behave as extended particles. Finally, we provide a linear stability analysis of periodic solutions which indicates short wavelength solutions to be stable.',

In order to produce the main results we deal with correspondences on the k-fold symmetric product of C, with some interesting linear subspaces of mathbb^n enjoying a condition of Cayley-Bacharach type, and with monodromy of rational maps.

This operator corresponds the boundary measurements when we have smooth sources supported on and the fields produced by these sources are observed on . We show that when and are disjoint but their closures intersect at least at one point, then the restricted Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator determines the Riemannian manifold and the metric on it up to an isometry. In the Euclidian space, the result yields that an anisotropic wave speed inside a compact body is determined, up to a natural coordinate transformations, by measurements on the boundary of the body even when wave sources are kept away from receivers. Moreover, we show that if we have three arbitrary non-empty open subsets , and of the boundary, then the restricted Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators for determine the Riemannian manifold to an isometry.

	{'abstract': u'Inspired by some intriguing examples, we study uniform association schemes and uniform coherent configurations, including cometric Q-antipodal association schemes. After a review of imprimitivity, we show that an imprimitive association scheme is uniform if and only if it is dismantlable, and we cast these schemes in the broader context of certain --- uniform --- coherent configurations. We also give a third characterization of uniform schemes in terms of the Krein parameters, and derive information on the primitive idempotents of such a scheme. In the second half of the paper, we apply these results to cometric association schemes. We show that each such scheme is uniform if and only if it is Q-antipodal, and derive results on the parameters of the subschemes and dismantled schemes of cometric Q-antipodal schemes. We revisit the correspondence between uniform indecomposable three-class schemes and linked systems of symmetric designs, and show that these are cometric Q-antipodal. We obtain a characterization of cometric Q-antipodal four-class schemes in terms of only a few parameters, and show that any strongly regular graph with a ("non-exceptional") strongly regular decomposition gives rise to such a scheme. Hemisystems in generalized quadrangles provide interesting examples of such decompositions. We finish with a short discussion of five-class schemes as well as a list of all feasible parameter sets for cometric Q-antipodal four-class schemes with at most six fibres and fibre size at most 2000, and describe the known examples. Most of these examples are related to groups, codes, and geometries.',

	{'abstract': u'Using a new method [9] it is possible to derive mean field equations from the microscopic N-body Schrodinger evolution of interacting particles without using BBGKY hierarchies. Recently this method was used to derive the Hartree equation for singular interactions [4] and the Gross Pitaevskii equation without positivity condition on the interaction [10] where one had to restrict the scaling behaviour of the interaction. In this paper more general scalings shall be considered assuming positivity of the interaction.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider locally conformal Kaehler geometry as an equivariant, homothetic Kaehler geometry (K, Gamma). We show that the de Rham class of the Lee form can be naturally identified with the homomorphism projecting Gamma to its dilation factors, thus completing the description of locally conformal Kaehler geometry in this equivariant setting. The rank r of a locally conformal Kaehler manifold is the rank of the image of this homomorphism. Using algebraic number theory, we show that r is non-trivial, providing explicit examples of locally conformal Kaehler manifolds with 1&lt;r&lt;b_1. As far as we know, these are the first examples of this kind. Moreover, we prove that locally conformal Kaehler Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds have either r=b_1 or r=b_1/2.',

We consider two classes of systems in n spatial dimensions, which respectively describe a point particle in a central force field and a freely rotating rigid body. In the former case, the application of the general methods to an integrable classical system leads in an almost straightforward way to the quasi-integrability of the corresponding quantum system. In the latter case instead, a modification of the symmetrization procedure is necessary in order to achieve quantum integrability for n=6.',

	{'abstract': u'On the set of mappings of the given set, we define the product of mappings. If A is associative algebra, then we consider the set of matrices, whose elements are linear mappings of algebra A. In algebra of matrices of linear mappings we define the operation of product. The operation is based on the product of mappings. If the matrix a of linear mappings has an inverse matrix, then the quasideterminant of the matrix a and the inverse matrix are matrices of linear mappings. In the paper, I consider conditions when a matrix of linear mappings has inverse matrix, as well methods of solving a system of linear equations in an associative algebra.',

These convex bodies give information about the Hilbert function as well as multiplicities of irreducible representations appearing in the graded algebra. We extend the notion of Duistermaat-Heckman measure to graded G-algebras and prove a Fujita type approximation theorem and a Brunn-Minkowski inequality for this measure. This in particular applies to arbitrary G-line bundles giving an equivariant version of the theory of volumes of line bundles. We generalize the Brion-Kazarnowski formula for the degree of a spherical variety to arbitrary G-varieties. Our approach follows some of the previous works of A. Okounkov. We use the asymptotic theory of semigroups of integral points and Newton-Okounkov bodies developed in our ealier work arXiv:0904.3350',

	{'abstract': u"The contraction of the Poincare group with respect to the space trans- lations subgroup gives rise to a group that bears a certain duality relation to the Galilei group, that is, the contraction limit of the Poincare group with respect to the time translations subgroup. In view of this duality, we call the former the dual Galilei group. A rather remarkable feature of the dual Galilei group is that the time translations constitute a central subgroup. Therewith, in unitary irreducible representations (UIR) of the group, the Hamiltonian appears as a Casimir operator proportional to the identity H = EI, with E (and a spin value s) uniquely characterizing the representation. Hence, a physical system characterized by a UIR of the dual Galilei group displays no non-trivial time evolution. Moreover, the combined U(1) gauge group and the dual Galilei group underlie a non- relativistic limit of Maxwell's equations known as the electric limit. The analysis presented here shows that only electrostatics is possible for the electric limit, wholly in harmony with the trivial nature of time evolution governed by the dual Galilei group.",

First, we find them by solving the -eigenvalue equations, using a method that can be applied to potentials that are polynomial in an exponential. A Mellin transform converts the -eigenvalue equations to difference equations, and factorized solutions are found directly for all values of the parameters. The symbols of both diagonal and off-diagonal density operator elements in the energy basis are found this way. The Wigner transforms of the density matrices built from the known wave functions are then shown to confirm the solutions.',

We prove that the logarithm of the analytic torsion of the cone decomposes as the sum of the logarithm of the root of the analytic torsion of the boundary of the cone, plus a topological term, plus a further term that is a rational linear combination of local Riemannian invariants of the boundary. We also prove that this last term coincides with the anomaly boundary term appearing in the Cheeger Muller theorem for a manifold with boundary, according to Bruning and Ma, either in the case that W is an odd sphere or has dimension smaller than six. It follows in particular that the Cheeger Muller theorem holds for the cone over an odd dimensional sphere. We also prove Poincare duality for the analytic torsion of a cone.',

	{'abstract': u'We determine the rate region of the Gaussian scalar-help-vector source-coding problem under a covariance matrix distortion constraint. The rate region is achieved by a Gaussian achievable scheme. We introduce a novel outer bounding technique to establish the converse of the main result. Our approach is based on lower bounding the problem with a potentially reduced dimensional problem by projecting the main source and imposing the distortion constraint in certain directions determined by the optimal Gaussian scheme. We also prove several properties that the optimal solution to the point-to-point rate-distortion problem for a vector Gaussian source under a covariance matrix distortion constraint satisfies. These properties play an important role in our converse proof. We further establish an outer bound to the rate region of the more general problem in which there are distortion constraints on both the sources. The outer bound is partially tight in general. We also study its tightness in some nontrivial cases.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the performance of the Neyman-Pearson detection of a stationary Gaussian process in noise, using a large wireless sensor network (WSN). In our model, each sensor compresses its observation sequence using a linear precoder. The final decision is taken by a fusion center (FC) based on the compressed information. Two families of precoders are studied: random iid precoders and orthogonal precoders. We analyse their performance in the regime where both the number of sensors k and the number of samples n per sensor tend to infinity at the same rate, that is, k/n tends to c in (0, 1). Contributions are as follows. 1) Using results of random matrix theory and on large Toeplitz matrices, it is proved that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson detector converges exponentially to zero, when the above families of precoders are used. Closed form expressions of the corresponding error exponents are provided. 2) In particular, we propose a practical orthogonal precoding strategy, the Principal Frequencies Strategy (PFS), which achieves the best error exponent among all orthogonal strategies, and which requires very few signaling overhead between the central processor and the nodes of the network. 3) Moreover, when the PFS is used, a simplified low-complexity testing procedure can be implemented at the FC. We show that the proposed suboptimal test enjoys the same error exponent as the Neyman-Pearson test, which indicates a similar asymptotic behaviour of the performance. We illustrate our findings by numerical experiments on some examples.',

The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by numerical examples.',

We illustrate how fractional sums can be used to derive infinite sum and special functions identities; the corresponding proofs turn out to be particularly simple and intuitive.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the so-called MIMO interference channel. This situation has relevance in applications such as multi-cell coordination in cellular networks as well as spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks among others. We address the design of precoding (i.e. beamforming) vectors at each sender with the aim of striking a compromise between beamforming gain at the intended receiver (Egoism) and the mitigation of interference created towards other receivers (Altruism). Combining egoistic and altruistic beamforming has been shown previously to be instrumental to optimizing the rates in a MISO interference channel (i.e. where receivers have no interference canceling capability) . Here we explore these game-theoretic concepts in the more general context of MIMO channels and using the framework of Bayesian games, allowing us to derive (semi-)distributed precoding techniques. We draw parallels with existing work on the MIMO interference channel, including rate-optimizing and interference-alignement precoding techniques, showing how such techniques may be improved and re-interpretated through a common prism based on balancing egoistic and altruistic beamforming.',

We determine a condition for quantum operators which can be a suitable replacement for the condition of functional independence for functions on the classical phase space. This condition is based on the properties of the main parts of the operators with respect to the momenta. We are led in this way to the definition of what we call a "quasi-integrable quantum system". This concept will be further developed in a series of following papers.',

	{'abstract': u"Recently, Scullard and Ziff noticed that a broad class of planar percolation models are self-dual under a simple condition that, in a parametrized version of such a model, reduces to a single equation. They state that the solution of the resulting equation gives the critical point. However, just as in the classical case of bond percolation on the square lattice, self-duality is simply the starting point: the mathematical difficulty is precisely showing that self-duality implies criticality. Here we do so for a generalization of the models considered by Scullard and Ziff. In these models, the states of the bonds need not be independent; furthermore, increasing events need not be positively correlated, so new techniques are needed in the analysis. The main new ingredients are a generalization of Harris's Lemma to products of partially ordered sets, and a new proof of a type of Russo-Seymour-Welsh Lemma with minimal symmetry assumptions.",

This choice, motivated by the analyticity of the underlying eigenfunctions, allows for a convergence of infinite order, as rigorously demonstrated through a priori error bounds when Chebyshev nodes are adopted.

The paper studies measurable functions f for which is closable in the norm topology or in the weak* topology. We obtain a characterisation of w*-closable multipliers and relate the question about norm closability to the theory of operator synthesis. We also study multipliers of two special types: if f is of Toeplitz type, that is, if f(x,y)=h(x-y), x,y in G, where G is a locally compact abelian group, then the closability of f is related to the local inclusion of h in the Fourier algebra A(G) of G.

These methods not only yield the linearizing transformations but also the solutions of the nonlinear equations. Here complex methods for a scalar ordinary differential equation are used for linearizing systems of two second-order ordinary and partial differential equations, which can use the power of the geometric method for writing the solutions.

	{'abstract': u'The Noether-like operators that play an essential role in writing down the invariants for systems of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are constructed. The classification of such operators is carried out with the help of analytic continuation of the Lagrangians on the line. Cases in which the Noether-like operators are also Noether symmetries for the systems of ODEs are briefly mentioned. In particular, the 8-dimensional maximal Noether subalgebra is remarkabely obtained for the simplest system of the free particle equations in two dimensions from the 5-dimensional complex Noether algebra. We present the effectivness of Noether-like operators as well as the determination of all first integrals of systems of nonlinear differential equation which have not been reported before. This study gives a new direction to construct first integrals for systems of nonlinear differential equations.',

Denote by Gr(d,A) the Grassmannian of d-subspaces of A (viewed as a k-vector space), and by GL_1(A) the algebraic k-group whose points are invertible elements of A. The group GL_1(A) acts naturally on Gr(d,A) (by the formula g.E=gE). The aim of this paper is to study some birational properties of this action. More precisely, let r be the gcd of d and dim(A). Under some hypothesis on A (satisfied if A/k is 'etale), I show that the variety Gr(d,A) is birationally and GL_1(A)-equivariantly isomorphic to the product of Gr(r,A) by a projective space (on which GL_1(A) acts trivially). By twisting, this result has some corollaries in the theory of central simple algebras. For instance, let B and C be two central simple algebras over k, of coprime degrees. Then the Severi-Brauer variety SB(B otimes C) is birational to the product of SB(B) times SB(C) by an affine space of the correct dimension. These corollaries are in the spirit of Krashen's generalized version of Amitsur's conjecture.",

The key idea is to simultaneously decode the combined interference signal and the intended message at each receiver. It is shown that this interference-decoding inner bound is tight under certain strong interference conditions. The inner bound is also shown to strictly contain the inner bound obtained by treating interference as noise, which includes interference alignment for deterministic channels. The gain comes from judicious analysis of the number of combined interference sequences in different regimes of input distributions and message rates. Finally, the inner bound is generalized to the case where each channel output is observed through a noisy channel.',

	{'abstract': u'In a joint work with Saji, the second and the third authors gave an intrinsic formulation of wave fronts and proved a realization theorem of wave fronts in space forms. As an application, we show that the following four objects are essentially same; * conformally flat n-manifolds (n&gt;=3) with admissible singular points (i.e. admissible GCF-manifolds), * frontals as hypersurfaces in the lightcone Q^_+, * frontals as hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space H^, * sapacelike frontals as hypersurfaces in the de Sitter space S^_1. Recently, the duality of conformally flat Riemannian manifolds was found by several geometers. In our setting, this duality can be explained via the existence of a two-fold map of the congruent classes of admissible GCF-manifolds into that of frontals in H^. It should be remarked that the dual conformally flat metric may have degenerate points even when the original conformally flat metric is positive definite. This is the reason why we consider conformally flat manifolds with singular points. In fact, the duality is an involution on the set of admissible GCF-manifolds. The case n=2 requires an exceptional treatment, since any Riemannian 2-manifolds are conformally flat. At the end of this paper, we also determine the moduli space of isometric immersions of a given simply connected Riemannian 2-manifold into the lightcone Q^_+.',

We prove that the self-intersection number is bounded above by L^2/4 + L/2 - 1, and that when L is even, this bound is sharp; in that case there are exactly four distinct classes attaining that bound. When L is odd, we establish a smaller, conjectured upper bound ((L^2 - 1)/4)) in certain cases; and there we show it is sharp. Furthermore, for the doubly-punctured plane, these self-intersection numbers are bounded below, by L/2 - 1 if L is even, (L - 1)/2 if L is odd; these bounds are sharp.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is to give a geometric construction of the Bethe algebra (of Hamiltonians) of a Gaudin model associated to a simple Lie algebra. More precisely, in this paper a quantum integrable model is assigned to a weighted arrangement of affine hyperplanes. We show (under certain assumptions) that the algebra of Hamiltonians of the model is isomorphic to the algebra of functions on the critical set of the corresponding master function. For a discriminantal arrangement we show (under certain assumptions) that the symmetric part of the algebra of Hamiltonians is isomorphic to the Bethe algebra of the corresponding Gaudin model. It is expected that this correspondence holds in general (without the assumptions). As a byproduct of constructions we show that in a Gaudin model (associated to an arbitrary simple Lie algebra), the Bethe vector, corresponding to an isolated critical point of the master function, is nonzero.',

	{'abstract': u'Optimal binary labelings, input distributions, and input alphabets are analyzed for the so-called bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) capacity, paying special attention to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. For 8-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and for 0.75 bit/symbol, the folded binary code results in a higher capacity than the binary reflected gray code (BRGC) and the natural binary code (NBC). The 1 dB gap between the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) capacity and the BICM capacity with the BRGC can be almost completely removed if the input symbol distribution is properly selected. First-order asymptotics of the BICM capacity for arbitrary input alphabets and distributions, dimensions, mean, variance, and binary labeling are developed. These asymptotics are used to define first-order optimal (FOO) constellations for BICM, i.e. constellations that make BICM achieve the Shannon limit . It is shown that the required for reliable transmission at asymptotically low rates in BICM can be as high as infinity, that for uniform input distributions and 8-PAM there are only 72 classes of binary labelings with a different first-order asymptotic behavior, and that this number is reduced to only 26 for 8-ary phase shift keying (PSK). A general answer to the question of FOO constellations for BICM is also given: using the Hadamard transform, it is found that for uniform input distributions, a constellation for BICM is FOO if and only if it is a linear projection of a hypercube. A constellation based on PAM or quadrature amplitude modulation input alphabets is FOO if and only if they are labeled by the NBC; if the constellation is based on PSK input alphabets instead, it can never be FOO if the input alphabet has more than four points, regardless of the labeling.',

	{'abstract': u'We develop a localisation theory for certain categories, yielding a 3-arrow calculus: Every morphism in the localisation is represented by a diagram of length 3, and two such diagrams represent the same morphism if and only if they can be embedded in a 3-by-3 diagram in an appropriate way. The methods to construct this localisation are similar to the Ore localisation for a 2-arrow calculus; in particular, we do not have to use zigzags of arbitrary length. Applications include the localisation of an arbitrary model category with respect to its weak equivalences as well as the localisation of its full subcategories of cofibrant, fibrant and bifibrant objects, giving the homotopy category in all four cases. In contrast to the approach of Dwyer, Hirschhorn, Kan and Smith, the model category under consideration does not need to admit functorial factorisations. Moreover, our method shows that the derived category of any abelian (or idempotent splitting exact) category admits a 3-arrow calculus if we localise the category of complexes instead of its homotopy category.',

We determined the distribution of the aggregate interference and the error performance of the link. In this second part, we characterize the capacity of the link subject to both network interference and noise. Then, we put forth the concept of spectral outage probability (SOP), a new characterization of the aggregate radio-frequency emission generated by communicating nodes in a wireless network. We present some applications of the SOP, namely the establishment of spectral regulations and the design of covert military networks. The proposed framework captures all the essential physical parameters that affect the aggregate network emission, yet is simple enough to provide insights that may be of value in the design and deployment of wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a mathematical model for communication subject to both network interference and noise. We introduce a framework where the interferers are scattered according to a spatial Poisson process, and are operating asynchronously in a wireless environment subject to path loss, shadowing, and multipath fading. We consider both cases of slow and fast-varying interferer positions. The paper is comprised of two separate parts. In Part I, we determine the distribution of the aggregate network interference at the output of a linear receiver. We characterize the error performance of the link, in terms of average and outage probabilities. The proposed model is valid for any linear modulation scheme (e.g., M-ary phase shift keying or M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation), and captures all the essential physical parameters that affect network interference. Our work generalizes the conventional analysis of communication in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise and fast fading, allowing the traditional results to be extended to include the effect of network interference. In Part II of the paper, we derive the capacity of the link when subject to network interference and noise, and characterize the spectrum of the aggregate interference.',

	{'abstract': u"The level lines of the Gaussian free field are known to be related to SLE(4). It is shown how this relation allows to define chordal SLE(4) processes on doubly connected domains, describing traces that are anchored on one of the two boundary components. The precise nature of the processes depends on the conformally invariant boundary conditions imposed on the second boundary component. Extensions of Schramm's formula to doubly connected domains are given for the standard Dirichlet and Neumann conditions and a relation to first-exit problems for Brownian bridges is established. For the free field compactified at the self-dual radius, the extended symmetry leads to a class of conformally invariant boundary conditions parametrised by elements of SU(2). It is shown how to extend SLE(4) to this setting. This allows for a derivation of new passage probabilities a la Schramm that interpolate continuously from Dirichlet to Neumann conditions.",

Such a map is unique unless the group is two-ended. In order to optimize the proof and the usage of the map theorem we propose two new definitions of relative hyperbolicity equivalent to the other known definitions. In our approach some "visibility" conditions in graphs are essential. We introduce a class of "visibility actions" that contains the class of relatively hyperbolic actions. The convergence property still holds for the visibility actions. We describe and make use a rather general construction of "attractor sum" of two actions of a locally compact group.',

	{'abstract': u'The usual way to investigate the statistical properties of finitely generated subgroups of free groups, and of finite presentations of groups, is based on the so-called word-based distribution: subgroups are generated (finite presentations are determined) by randomly chosen k-tuples of reduced words, whose maximal length is allowed to tend to infinity. In this paper we adopt a different, though equally natural point of view: we investigate the statistical properties of the same objects, but with respect to the so-called graph-based distribution, recently introduced by Bassino, Nicaud and Weil. Here, subgroups (and finite presentations) are determined by randomly chosen Stallings graphs whose number of vertices tends to infinity. Our results show that these two distributions behave quite differently from each other, shedding a new light on which properties of finitely generated subgroups can be considered frequent or rare. For example, we show that malnormal subgroups of a free group are negligible in the graph-based distribution, while they are exponentially generic in the word-based distribution. Quite surprisingly, a random finite presentation generically presents the trivial group in this new distribution, while in the classical one it is known to generically present an infinite hyperbolic group.',

It says that a symmetric real polynomial of degree in variables is positive on (on ) if and only if it is so on the subset of points with at most distinct components. We deduce Timofte's original statement as a corollary of a slightly more general statement on symmetric optimization problems. The idea we are using to prove this statement is to relate it to a linear optimization problem in the orbit space. The fact that for the case of the symmetric group this can be viewed as a question on normalized univariate real polynomials with only real roots allows us to conclude the theorems in a very elementary way. We hope that the methods presented here will make it possible to derive similar statements also in the case of other groups.",

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the properties of the Hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm (HMC) in high dimensions. HMC develops a Markov chain reversible w.r.t. a given target distribution by using separable Hamiltonian dynamics with potential . The additional momentum variables are chosen at random from the Boltzmann distribution and the continuous-time Hamiltonian dynamics are then discretised using the leapfrog scheme. The induced bias is removed via a Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject rule. In the simplified scenario of independent, identically distributed components, we prove that, to obtain an acceptance probability as the dimension of the state space tends to , the leapfrog step-size should be scaled as . Therefore, in high dimensions, HMC requires steps to traverse the state space. We also identify analytically the asymptotically optimal acceptance probability, which turns out to be 0.651 (to three decimal places). This is the choice which optimally balances the cost of generating a proposal, which as increases, against the cost related to the average number of proposals required to obtain acceptance, which as increases.',

We explore the structure of the semilattice of intersections of the hyperplanes for generic reference points. The main theorem is that there is a real, additive gain graph (this is a graph with an additive real number associated invertibly to each edge) whose set of balanced flats has the same structure as the intersection semilattice. We examine the requirements for genericity, which are related to behavior at infinity but remain mysterious; also, variations in the construction rules for perpendiculars. We investigate several particular arrangements with a view to finding the exact numbers of faces of each dimension. The prototype, the arrangement of all perpendicular bisectors, was studied by Good and Tideman, motivated by a geometric voting theory. Most of our particular examples are suggested by extensions of that theory in which voters exercise finer discrimination. Throughout, we propose many research problems.',

	{'abstract': u'The deterministic wireless relay network model, introduced by Avestimehr et al., has been proposed for approximating Gaussian relay networks. This model, known as the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of wireless medium and interference. Avestimehr et al. showed that the Min-cut Max-flow theorem holds in the ADT network. In this paper, we show that the ADT network model can be described within the algebraic network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove that the ADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, called the "system matrix". We show that the min-cut of an ADT network is the rank of the system matrix; thus, eliminating the need to optimize over exponential number of cuts between two nodes to compute the min-cut of an ADT network. We extend the capacity characterization for ADT networks to a more general set of connections. Our algebraic approach not only provides the Min-cut Max-flow theorem for a single unicast/multicast connection, but also extends to non-multicast connections such as multiple multicast, disjoint multicast, and two-level multicast. We also provide sufficiency conditions for achievability in ADT networks for any general connection set. In addition, we show that the random linear network coding, a randomized distributed algorithm for network code construction, achieves capacity for the connections listed above. Finally, we extend the ADT networks to those with random erasures and cycles (thus, allowing bi-directional links). Note that ADT network was proposed for approximating the wireless networks; however, ADT network is acyclic. Furthermore, ADT network does not model the stochastic nature of the wireless links. With our algebraic framework, we incorporate both cycles as well as random failures into ADT network model.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is to describe and clarify as much as possible the 3-dimensional topology underlying the Helmholtz cuts method, which occurs in a wide theoretic and applied literature about Electromagnetism, Fluid dynamics and Elasticity on domains of the ordinary space. We consider two classes of bounded domains that satisfy mild boundary conditions and that become "simple" after a finite number of disjoint cuts along properly embedded surfaces. For the first class (Helmholtz), "simple" means that every curl-free smooth vector field admits a potential. For the second (weakly-Helmholtz), we only require that a potential exists for the restriction of every curl-free smooth vector field defined on the whole initial domain. By means of classical and rather elementary facts of 3-dimensional geometric and algebraic topology, we give an exhaustive description of Helmholtz domains, realizing that their topology is forced to be quite elementary (in particular, Helmholtz domains with connected boundary are just possibly knotted handlebodies, and the complement of any non-trivial link is not Helmholtz). The discussion about weakly-Helmholtz domains is a bit more advanced, and their classification appears to be a quite difficult issue. Nevertheless, we provide several interesting characterizations of them and, in particular, we point out that the class of links with weakly-Helmholtz complements eventually coincides with the class of the so-called homology boundary links, that have been widely studied in Knot Theory.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a computationally-efficient method for recovering sparse signals from a series of noisy observations, known as the problem of compressed sensing (CS). CS theory requires solving a convex constrained minimization problem. We propose to transform this optimization problem into a convex feasibility problem (CFP), and solve it using subgradient projection methods, which are iterative, fast, robust and convergent schemes for solving CFPs. As opposed to some of the recently-introduced CS algorithms, such as Bayesian CS and gradient projections for sparse reconstruction, which become inefficient as the problem dimension and sparseness degree increase, the newly-proposed methods exhibit a marked robustness with respect to these factors. This renders the subgradient projection methods highly viable for large-scale compressible scenarios.',

	{'abstract': u"Training over sparse multipath channels is explored. The energy allocation and the optimal shape of training signals that enable error free communications over unknown channels are characterized as a function of the channels' statistics. The performance of training is evaluated by the reduction of the mean square error of the channel estimate and by the decrease in the uncertainty of the channel. A connection between the entropy of the wideband channel and the required energy for training is shown. In addition, there is a linkage between the sparsity and the entropy of the channel to the number of required channel measurements when the training is based on compressed sensing. The ability to learn the channel from few measurements is connected to the low entropy of sparse channels that enables training in the low SNR regime.",

	{'abstract': u"We show that the discrete complex, and numerous hypercomplex, Fourier transforms defined and used so far by a number of researchers can be unified into a single framework based on a matrix exponential version of Euler's formula , and a matrix root of -1 isomorphic to the imaginary root . The transforms thus defined can be computed using standard matrix multiplications and additions with no hypercomplex code, the complex or hypercomplex algebra being represented by the form of the matrix root of -1, so that the matrix multiplications are equivalent to multiplications in the appropriate algebra. We present examples from the complex, quaternion and biquaternion algebras, and from Clifford algebras Cl1,1 and Cl2,0. The significance of this result is both in the theoretical unification, and also in the scope it affords for insight into the structure of the various transforms, since the formulation is such a simple generalization of the classic complex case. It also shows that hypercomplex discrete Fourier transforms may be computed using standard matrix arithmetic packages without the need for a hypercomplex library, which is of importance in providing a reference implementation for verifying implementations based on hypercomplex code.",

	{'abstract': u'The energy levels of quantum systems are determined by quantization conditions. For one-dimensional anharmonic oscillators, one can transform the Schrodinger equation into a Riccati form, i.e., in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function. A perturbative expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function can easily be obtained. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition can be expressed in terms of a contour integral around the poles of the logarithmic derivative. Its functional form is B_m(E,g) = n + 1/2, where B is a characteristic function of the anharmonic oscillator of degree m, E is the resonance energy, and g is the coupling constant. A recursive scheme can be devised which facilitates the evaluation of higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brioullin (WKB) approximants. The WKB expansion of the logarithmic derivative of the wave function has a cut in the tunneling region. The contour integral about the tunneling region yields the instanton action plus corrections, summarized in a second characteristic function A_m(E,g). The evaluation of A_m(E,g) by the method of asymptotic matching is discussed for the case of the cubic oscillator of degree m=3.',

	{'abstract': u'We address two fundamental questions in the representation theory of affine Hecke algebras of classical types. One is an inductive algorithm to compute characters of tempered modules, and the other is the determination of the constants in the formal degrees of discrete series (in the form conjectured by Reeder cite). The former is completely different than the Lusztig-Shoji algorithm cite, and it is more effective in a number of cases. The main idea in our proof is to introduce a new family of representations which behave like tempered modules, but for which it is easier to analyze the effect of parameter specializations. Our proof also requires a comparison of the -theoretic results of Opdam, Delorme, Slooten, Solleveld cite, and the geometric construction from cite.',

We characterize the reconstruction performance by the critical relation of the successful reconstruction between the ratio and the density of non-zero elements in in the limit while keeping and allowing asymptotically negligible reconstruction errors. We show that the critical relation holds universally as long as can be characterized asymptotically by a rotationally invariant random matrix ensemble and is typically of full rank. This supports the universality of the critical relation observed by Donoho and Tanner (, vol.~367, pp.~4273--4293, 2009; arXiv: 0807.3590) for various ensembles of compression matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'The field of compressed sensing has shown that a sparse but otherwise arbitrary vector can be recovered exactly from a small number of randomly constructed linear projections (or samples). The question addressed in this paper is whether an even smaller number of samples is sufficient when there exists prior knowledge about the distribution of the unknown vector, or when only partial recovery is needed. An information-theoretic lower bound with connections to free probability theory and an upper bound corresponding to a computationally simple thresholding estimator are derived. It is shown that in certain cases (e.g. discrete valued vectors or large distortions) the number of samples can be decreased. Interestingly though, it is also shown that in many cases no reduction is possible.',

	{'abstract': u'For every natural number k we introduce the notion of k-th order convolution of functions on abelian groups. We study the group of convolution preserving automorphisms of function algebras in the limit. It turns out that such groups have k-nilpotent factor groups explaining why k-th order Fourier analysis has non-commutative features. To demonstrate our method in the quadratic case we develop a new quadratic representation theory on finite abelian groups. We introduce the notion of a quadrtic nil-morphism of an abelian group into a two step nil-manifold. We prove a structure theorem saying that any bounded function on a finite abelian group is decomposable into a structured part (which is the composition of a nil-morphism with a bounded complexity continuous function) and a random looking part with small U3 norm. It implies a new inverse theorem for the U3 norm. (The general case for Un, n&gt;3 will be discussed in the next part of this sequence.) We point out that our framework creates interesting limit objects for functions on finite (or compact) abelian groups that are measurable functions on nil-manifolds.',

	{'abstract': u'The N-dependence of the non-relativistic bosonic ground state energy is studied for quantum N-body systems with either Coulomb or Newton interactions. The Coulomb systems are "bosonic atoms," with their nucleus fixed, and the Newton systems are "bosonic stars". In either case there exists some third order polynomial in N such that the ratio of the ground state energy to the respective polynomial grows monotonically in N. Some applications of these new monotonicity results are discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses weight optimization problem in distributed consensus averaging algorithm over networks with symmetric star topology. We have determined optimal weights and convergence rate of the network in terms of its topological parameters. In addition, two alternative topologies with more rapid convergence rates have been introduced. The new topologies are Complete-Cored Symmetric (CCS) star and K-Cored Symmetric (KCS) star topologies. It has been shown that the optimal weights for the edges of central part in symmetric and CCS star configurations are independent of their branches. By simulation optimality of obtained weights under quantization constraints have been verified.',

	{'abstract': u'Vershik and Kerov conjectured in 1985 that dimensions of irreducible representations of finite symmetric groups, after appropriate normalization, converge to a constant with respect to the Plancherel family of measures on the space of Young diagrams. The statement of the Vershik-Kerov conjecture can be seen as an analogue of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem for the non-stationary Markov process of the growth of a Young diagram. The limiting constant is then interpreted as the entropy of the Plancherel measure. The main result of the paper is the proof of the Vershik-Kerov conjecture. The argument is based on the methods of Borodin, Okounkov and Olshanski.',

	{'abstract': u'The capacity region of multi-pair bidirectional relay networks, in which a relay node facilitates the communication between multiple pairs of users, is studied. This problem is first examined in the context of the linear shift deterministic channel model. The capacity region of this network when the relay is operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex mode for arbitrary number of pairs is characterized. It is shown that the cut-set upper-bound is tight and the capacity region is achieved by a so called divide-and-conquer relaying strategy. The insights gained from the deterministic network are then used for the Gaussian bidirectional relay network. The strategy in the deterministic channel translates to a specific superposition of lattice codes and random Gaussian codes at the source nodes and successive interference cancelation at the receiving nodes for the Gaussian network. The achievable rate of this scheme with two pairs is analyzed and it is shown that for all channel gains it achieves to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user of the cut-set upper-bound. Hence, the capacity region of the two-pair bidirectional Gaussian relay network to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user is characterized.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that the theory of hyperrings, due to M. Krasner, supplies a perfect framework to understand the algebraic structure of the adele class space of a global field. After promoting F1 to a hyperfield K, we prove that a hyperring of the form R/G (where R is a ring and G is a subgroup of its multiplicative group) is a hyperring extension of K if and only if G union 0 is a subfield of R. This result applies to the adele class space which thus inherits the structure of a hyperring extension H of K. We begin to investigate the content of an algebraic geometry over K. The category of commutative hyperring extensions of K is inclusive of: commutative algebras over fields with semi-linear homomorphisms, abelian groups with injective homomorphisms and a rather exotic land comprising homogeneous non-Desarguesian planes. Finally, we show that for a global field of positive characteristic, the groupoid of the prime elements of the hyperring H is canonically and equivariantly isomorphic to the groupoid of the loops of the maximal abelian cover of the curve associated to the global field.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a technique for derivation of a priori bounds for Gevrey-Sobolev norms of space-periodic three-dimensional solutions to evolutionary partial differential equations of hydrodynamic type. It involves a transformation of the flow velocity in the Fourier space, which introduces a feedback between the index of the norm and the norm of the transformed solution, and results in emergence of a mildly dissipative term. To illustrate the technique, we derive finite-time bounds for Gevrey-Sobolev norms of solutions to the Euler and inviscid Burgers equations, and global in time bounds for the Voigt-type regularisations of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equation (assuming that the respective norm of the initial condition is bounded). The boundedness of the norms implies analyticity of the solutions in space.',

	{'abstract': u'A gain graph is a graph whose edges are labelled invertibly by "gains" from a group. "Switching" is a transformation of gain graphs that generalizes conjugation in a group. A "weak chromatic function" of gain graphs with gains in a fixed group satisfies three laws: deletion-contraction for links with neutral gain, invariance under switching, and nullity on graphs with a neutral loop. The laws lead to the "weak chromatic group" of gain graphs, which is the universal domain for weak chromatic functions. We find expressions, valid in that group, for a gain graph in terms of minors without neutral-gain edges, or with added complete neutral-gain subgraphs, that generalize the expression of an ordinary chromatic polynomial in terms of monomials or falling factorials. These expressions imply relations for chromatic functions of gain graphs. We apply our relations to some special integral gain graphs including those that correspond to the Shi, Linial, and Catalan arrangements, thereby obtaining new evaluations of and new ways to calculate the zero-free chromatic polynomial and the integral and modular chromatic functions of these gain graphs, hence the characteristic polynomials and hypercubical lattice-point counting functions of the arrangements. We also calculate the total chromatic polynomial of any gain graph and especially of the Catalan, Shi, and Linial gain graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We give a spinorial characterization of isometrically immersed surfaces of arbitrary signature into 3-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space forms. For Lorentzian surfaces, this generalizes a recent work of the first author in to other Lorentzian space forms. We also characterize immersions of Riemannian surfaces in these spaces. From this we can deduce analogous results for timelike immersions of Lorentzian surfaces in space forms of corresponding signature, as well as for spacelike and timelike immersions of surfaces of signature (0,2), hence achieving a complete spinorial description for this class of pseudo-Riemannian immersions.',

	{'abstract': u"We improve the existing achievable rate regions for causal and for zero-delay source coding of stationary Gaussian sources under an average mean squared error (MSE) distortion measure. To begin with, we find a closed-form expression for the information-theoretic causal rate-distortion function (RDF) under such distortion measure, denoted by , for first-order Gauss-Markov processes. Rc^(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA) by any causal source code, namely Rc^(D). We show that, for Gaussian sources, the latter can also be upper bounded as Rc^(D) leq Rc^(D) + 0.5 log_(2 pi e) bits/sample. In order to analyze for arbitrary zero-mean Gaussian stationary sources, we introduce bar(D), the information-theoretic causal RDF when the reconstruction error is jointly stationary with the source. Based upon bar(D), we derive three closed-form upper bounds to the additive rate loss defined as bar(D) - R(D), where R(D) denotes Shannon's RDF. Two of these bounds are strictly smaller than 0.5 bits/sample at all rates. These bounds differ from one another in their tightness and ease of evaluation; the tighter the bound, the more involved its evaluation. We then show that, for any source spectral density and any positive distortion D leq sigma_^, bar(D) can be realized by an AWGN channel surrounded by a unique set of causal pre-, post-, and feedback filters. We show that finding such filters constitutes a convex optimization problem. In order to solve the latter, we propose an iterative optimization procedure that yields the optimal filters and is guaranteed to converge to bar(D). Finally, by establishing a connection to feedback quantization we design a causal and a zero-delay coding scheme which, for Gaussian sources, achieves...",

	{'abstract': u'R is called a right WV -ring if each simple right R-module is injective relative to proper cyclics. If R is a right WV -ring, then R is right uniform or a right V -ring. It is shown that for a right WV-ring R, R is right noetherian if and only if each right cyclic module is a direct sum of a projective module and a CS or noetherian module. For a finitely generated module M with projective socle over a V -ring R such that every subfactor of M is a direct sum of a projective module and a CS or noetherian module, we show M = X oplus T, where X is semisimple and T is noetherian with zero socle. In the case that M = R, we get R = S oplus T, where S is a semisimple artinian ring, and T is a direct sum of right noetherian simple rings with zero socle. In addition, if R is a von Neumann regular ring, then it is semisimple artinian.',

	{'abstract': u'We prove a measure-theoretic identity that underlies all transient fluctuation theorems (TFTs) for entropy production and dissipated work in inhomogeneous deterministic and stochastic processes, including those of Evans and Searles, Crooks, and Seifert. The identity is used to deduce a tautological physical interpretation of TFTs in terms of the arrow of time, and its generality reveals that the self-inverse nature of the various trajectory and process transformations historically relied upon to prove TFTs, while necessary for these theorems from a physical standpoint, is not necessary from a mathematical one. The moment generating functions of thermodynamic variables appearing in the identity are shown to converge in general only in a vertical strip in the complex plane, with the consequence that a TFT that holds over arbitrary timescales may fail to give rise to an asymptotic fluctuation theorem for any possible speed of the corresponding large deviation principle. The case of strongly biased birth-death chains is presented to illustrate this phenomenon. We also discuss insights obtained from our measure-theoretic formalism into the results of Saha et. al. on the breakdown of TFTs for driven Brownian particles.',

	{'abstract': u'It is known that the capacity of parallel (e.g., multi-carrier) Gaussian point-to-point, multiple access and broadcast channels can be achieved by separate encoding for each subchannel (carrier) subject to a power allocation across carriers. Recent results have shown that parallel interference channels are not separable, i.e., joint coding is needed to achieve capacity in general. This work studies the separability, from a sum-capacity perspective, of single hop Gaussian interference networks with independent messages and arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers. The main result is that the only network that is always (for all values of channel coefficients) separable from a sum-capacity perspective is the MAC-Z-BC network, i.e., a network where a MAC component and a BC component are linked by a Z component. The sum capacity of this network is explicitly characterized.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the recovery of a nonnegative vector x from measurements y = Ax, where A is an m-by-n matrix whos entries are in . We establish that when A corresponds to the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph with sufficient expansion, a simple message-passing algorithm produces an estimate hat of x satisfying ||x- hat||_1 leq O(n/k) ||x-x(k)||_1, where x(k) is the best k-sparse approximation of x. The algorithm performs O(n (log(n/k))^2 log(k)) computation in total, and the number of measurements required is m = O(k log(n/k)). In the special case when x is k-sparse, the algorithm recovers x exactly in time O(n log(n/k) log(k)). Ultimately, this work is a further step in the direction of more formally developing the broader role of message-passing algorithms in solving compressed sensing problems.',

	{'abstract': u'We use contact fiber sums of open book decompositions to define an infinite hierarchy of filling obstructions for contact 3-manifolds, called planar k-torsion for nonnegative integers k, all of which cause the contact invariant in Embedded Contact Homology to vanish. Planar 0-torsion is equivalent to overtwistedness, while every contact manifold with Giroux torsion also has planar 1-torsion, and we give examples of contact manifolds that have planar k-torsion for any but no Giroux torsion, leading to many new examples of nonfillable contact manifolds. We show also that the complement of the binding of a supporting open book never has planar torsion. The technical basis of these results is an existence and uniqueness theorem for J-holomorphic curves with positive ends approaching the (possibly blown up) binding of an ensemble of open book decompositions.',

Our implementation is an improvement to Pollard\'s Kangaroo method in infrastructures, using distribution results of class numbers as well as information on the congruence class of the divisor class number, and an adaptation that efficiently navigates these torus-shaped infrastructures. Moreover, this is the first time that an efficient "square-root" algorithm has been applied to the infrastructure of a global field of unit rank 2.

	{'abstract': u"Subject to a range of side conditions, the two weight inequality for the Hilbert transform is characterized in terms of (1) a Poisson A_2 condition on the weights (2) A forward testing condition, in which the two weight inequality is tested on intervals (3) and a backwards testing condition, dual to (2). A critical new concept in the proof is an Energy Condition, which incorporates information about the distribution of the weights in question inside intervals. This condition is a consequence of the three conditions above. The Side Conditions are termed 'Energy Hypotheses'. At one endpoint they are necessary for the two weight inequality, and at the other, they are the Pivotal Conditions of Nazarov-Treil-Volberg. This new concept is combined with a known proof strategy devised by Nazarov-Treil-Volberg. A counterexample shows that the Pivotal Condition are not necessary for the two weight inequality.",

	{'abstract': u'In this study, we are concerned with introducing Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for a class of dynamic linear Hamiltonian nabla systems over a half-line on Sturmian time scales. After developing fundamental properties of solutions and regular spectral problems, we introduce the corresponding maximal and minimal operators for the system. Matrix disks are constructed and proved to be nested and converge to a limiting set. Some precise relationships among the rank of the matrix radius of the limiting set, the number of linearly independent square summable solutions, and the defect indices of the minimal operator are established. Using the above results, a classification of singular dynamic linear Hamiltonian nabla systems is given in terms of the defect indices of the minimal operator, and several equivalent conditions on the cases of limit point and limit circle are obtained, respectively. These results unify and extend certain classic and recent results on the subject in the continuous and discrete cases, respectively, to Sturmian time scales.',

	{'abstract': u'The classical matrix-tree theorem relates the determinant of the combinatorial Laplacian on a graph to the number of spanning trees. We generalize this result to Laplacians on one- and two-dimensional vector bundles, giving a combinatorial interpretation of their determinants in terms of so-called cycle rooted spanning forests (CRSFs). We construct natural measures on CRSFs for which the edges form a determinantal process. This theory gives a natural generalization of the spanning tree process adapted to graphs embedded on surfaces. We give a number of other applications, for example, we compute the probability that a loop-erased random walk on a planar graph between two vertices on the outer boundary passes left of two given faces. This probability cannot be computed using the standard Laplacian alone.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the problem of finding an explicit description of a developable narrow Moebius strip of minimal bending energy, which was first formulated by M. Sadowsky in 1930, we will develop the theory of elastic strips. Recently E.L. Starostin and G.H.M. van der Heijden found a numerical description for an elastic Moebius strip, but did not give an integrable solution. We derive two conservation laws, which describe the equilibrium equations of elastic strips. In applying these laws we find two new classes of integrable elastic strips which correspond to spherical elastic curves. We establish a connection between Hopf tori and force--free strips, which are defined by one of the integrable strips, we have found. We introduce the P--functional and relate it to elastic strips.',

A concept of self-adjointness of the boundary conditions is introduced. The self-adjointness of the corresponding dynamic operator is discussed on a suitable admissible function space, and fundamental spectral results are obtained. The dual orthogonality of eigenfunctions is shown in a special case. Extensions to even-order Sturm-Liouville dynamic equations, linear Hamiltonian and symplectic nabla systems on general time scales are also discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies composite quantum systems, like atom-cavity systems and coupled optical resonators, in the absence of external driving by resorting to methods from quantum field theory. Going beyond the rotating wave approximation, it is shown that the usually neglected counter-rotating part of the Hamiltonian relates to the entropy operator and generates an irreversible time evolution. The vacuum state of the system is shown to evolve into a generalized coherent state exhibiting entanglement of the modes in which the counter-rotating terms are expressed. Possible consequences at observational level in quantum optics experiments are currently under study.',

	{'abstract': u'A methodology to analyze the properties of the first (largest) eigenvalue and its eigenvector is developed for large symmetric random sparse matrices utilizing the cavity method of statistical mechanics. Under a tree approximation, which is plausible for infinitely large systems, in conjunction with the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier for constraining the length of the eigenvector, the eigenvalue problem is reduced to a bunch of optimization problems of a quadratic function of a single variable, and the coefficients of the first and the second order terms of the functions act as cavity fields that are handled in cavity analysis. We show that the first eigenvalue is determined in such a way that the distribution of the cavity fields has a finite value for the second order moment with respect to the cavity fields of the first order coefficient. The validity and utility of the developed methodology are examined by applying it to two analytically solvable and one simple but non-trivial examples in conjunction with numerical justification.',

Recent advances in the field of large dimensional random matrix theory are used that result in a simple and computationally efficient consistent estimator of the power of each source. A criterion to determine the minimum number of sensors and the minimum number of samples required to achieve source separation is then introduced. Simulations are performed that corroborate the theoretical claims and show that the proposed power estimator largely outperforms alternative power inference techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, Cappell and Miller extended the classical construction of the analytic torsion for de Rham complexes to coupling with an arbitrary flat bundle and the holomorphic torsion for -complexes to coupling with an arbitrary holomorphic bundle with compatible connection of type . Cappell and Miller studied the properties of these torsions, including the behavior under metric deformations. On the other hand, Mathai and Wu generalized the classical construction of the analytic torsion to the twisted de Rham complexes with an odd degree closed form as a flux and later, more generally, to the -graded elliptic complexes. Mathai and Wu also studied the properties of analytic torsions for the -graded elliptic complexes, including the behavior under metric and flux deformations. In this paper we define the Cappell-Miller holomorphic torsion for the twisted Dolbeault-type complexes and the Cappell-Miller analytic torsion for the twisted de Rham complexes. We obtain variation formulas for the twisted Cappell-Miller holomorphic and analytic torsions under metric and flux deformations.',

	{'abstract': u"A method to construct girth-12 (3,L) quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes with all lengths larger than a certain given number is proposed, via a given girth-12 code subjected to some constraints. The lengths of these codes can be arbitrary integers of the form LP, provided that P is larger than a tight lower bound determined by the maximal element within the exponent matrix of the given girth-12 code. By applying the method to the case of row-weight six, we obtained a family of girth-12 (3,6) QC-LDPC codes for arbitrary lengths above 2688, which includes 30 member codes with shorter code lengths compared with the shortest girth-12 (3,6) QC-LDPC codes reported by O'Sullivan.",

	{'abstract': u'Provable lower bounds are presented for the information rate I(X; X+S+N) where X is the symbol drawn from a fixed, finite-size alphabet, S a discrete-valued random variable (RV) and N a Gaussian RV. The information rate I(X; X+S+N) serves as a tight lower bound for capacity of intersymbol interference (ISI) channels corrupted by Gaussian noise. The new bounds can be calculated with a reasonable computational load and provide a similar level of tightness as the well-known conjectured lower bound by Shamai and Laroia for a good range of finite-ISI channels of practical interest. The computation of the presented bounds requires the evaluation of the magnitude sum of the precursor ISI terms as well as the identification of dominant terms among them seen at the output of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) decision feedback equalizer (DFE).',

	{'abstract': u'This is the third article in a series of three papers on the resonance energy levels of anharmonic oscillators. Whereas the first two papers mainly dealt with double-well potentials and modifications thereof [see J. Zinn-Justin and U. D. Jentschura, Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) 313 (2004), pp. 197 and 269], we here focus on simple even and odd anharmonic oscillators for arbitrary magnitude and complex phase of the coupling parameter. A unification is achieved by the use of PT-symmetry inspired dispersion relations and generalized quantization conditions that include instanton configurations. Higher-order formulas are provided for the oscillators of degrees 3 to 8, which lead to subleading corrections to the leading factorial growth of the perturbative coefficients describing the resonance energies. Numerical results are provided, and higher-order terms are found to be numerically significant. The resonances are described by generalized expansions involving intertwined non-analytic exponentials, logarithmic terms and power series. Finally, we summarize spectral properties and dispersion relations of anharmonic oscillators, and their interconnections. The purpose is to look at one of the classic problems of quantum theory from a new perspective, through which we gain systematic access to the phenomenologically significant higher-order terms.',

We refer to this setup as 2DMBC. We define the secret-key capacity in the 2DMBC setup and prove lower and upper bounds on this capacity.

	{'abstract': u'We provide a novel upper-bound on Witsenhausen\'s rate, the rate required in the zero-error analogue of the Slepian-Wolf problem; our bound is given in terms of a new information-theoretic functional defined on a certain graph. We then use the functional to give a single letter lower-bound on the error exponent for the Slepian-Wolf problem under the vanishing error probability criterion, where the decoder has full (i.e. unencoded) side information. Our exponent stems from our new encoding scheme which makes use of source distribution only through the positions of the zeros in the `channel\' matrix connecting the source with the side information, and in this sense is `semi-universal\'. We demonstrate that our error exponent can beat the `expurgated\' source-coding exponent of Csisz \'r and K "rner, achievability of which requires the use of a non-universal maximum-likelihood decoder. An extension of our scheme to the lossy case (i.e. Wyner-Ziv) is given. For the case when the side information is a deterministic function of the source, the exponent of our improved scheme agrees with the sphere-packing bound exactly (thus determining the reliability function). An application of our functional to zero-error channel capacity is also given.',

This approach was proved to be a rigorous limit of the network equations in a general setting, and we express here the results in a more customary and simpler framework. We propose a heuristic argument to derive these equations providing a more intuitive understanding of their origin. These equations are characterized by a strong coupling between the different moments of the solutions. We analyse the equations, present an algorithm to simulate the solutions of these mean-field equations, and investigate numerically the equations. In particular, we build a bridge between these equations and Sompolinsky and collaborators approach (1988, 1990), and show how the coupling between the mean and the covariance function deviates from customary approaches.',

	{'abstract': u'Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians are Lagrangian submanifolds that are critical points of the volume functional under Hamiltonian deformations. They can be considered as a generalization of special Lagrangians or Lagrangian and minimal submanifolds. Joyce, Schoen and the author show that given any compact rigid Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian in , one can always find a family of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangians of the same type in any compact symplectic manifolds with a compatible metric. The advantage of this result is that it holds in very general classes. But the disadvantage is that we do not know where these examples locate and examples in this family might be far apart. In this paper, we derive a local condition on Kahler manifolds which ensures the existence of one family of Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian tori near a point with given frame satisfying the criterion. Butscher and Corvino ever proposed a condition in n=2. But our condition appears to be different from theirs. The condition derived in this paper not only works for any dimension, but also for the Clifford torus case which is not covered by their condition.',

Some versions of these games have been motivated by research in complexity theory and have ties to well-known research problems in coding theory, and some variations have led to interesting new research. In this paper, we review Ebert\'s Hat Game, which garnered a considerable amount of publicity in the late 90\'s and early 00\'s, and the Hats-on-a-line Game. Then we introduce a new hat game which is a "hybrid" of these two games and provide an optimal strategy for playing the new game. The optimal strategy is quite simple, but the proof involves an interesting combinatorial argument.',

	{'abstract': u'In operator algebra theory, a conditional expectation is usually assumed to be a projection map onto a sub-algebra. In the paper, a further type of conditional expectation and an extension of the Lueders - von Neumann measurement to observables with continuous spectra are considered; both are defined for a single operator and become a projection map only if they exist for all operators. Criteria for the existence of the different types of conditional expectation and of the extension of the Lueders - von Neumann measurement are presented, and the question whether they coincide is studied. All this is done in the general framework of Jordan operator algebras. The examples considered include the type I and type II operator algebras, the standard Hilbert space model of quantum mechanics, and a no-go result concerning the conditional expectation of observables that satisfy the canonical commutator relation.',

	{'abstract': u'An extension of the conditional expectations (those under a given subalgebra of events and not the simple ones under a single event) from the classical to the quantum case is presented. In the classical case, the conditional expectations always exist; in the quantum case, however, they exist only if a certain weak compatibility criterion is satisfied. This compatibility criterion was introduced among others in a recent paper by the author. Then, state-independent conditional expectations and quantum Markov processes are studied. A classical Markov process is a probability measure, together with a system of random variables, satisfying the Markov property and can equivalently be described by a system of Markovian kernels (often forming a semigroup). This equivalence is partly extended to quantum probabilities. It is shown that a dynamical (semi)group can be derived from a given system of quantum observables satisfying the Markov property, and the group generators are studied. The results are presented in the framework of Jordan operator algebras, and a very general type of observables (including the usual real-valued observables or self-adjoint operators) is considered.',

The algorithm has an application in the context of curve based cryptography. One distinguished property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends quasi-quadratically on the degree of the finite base field. Our algorithm is a modified version of an earlier method that was developed in joint work with Lubicz. We explain how one can alter the original algorithm, on the basis of new theory, such that it can be used to efficiently count points on genus two curves over large finite fields. Examples of cryptographic size have been computed using an experimental Magma implementation of the algorithm which has been programmed by the author. Our computational results show that the quasi-quadratic algorithm of Lubicz and the author, with some improvements, is practical and relevant for cryptography.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a simple technique to compute moments of derivatives of unitary characteristic polynomials. The first part of the technique relies on an idea of Bump and Gamburd: it uses orthonormality of Schur functions over unitary groups to compute matrix averages of characteristic polynomials. In order to consider derivatives of those polynomials, we here need the added strength of the Generalized Binomial Theorem of Okounkov and Olshanski. This result is very natural as it provides coefficients for the Taylor expansions of Schur functions, in terms of shifted Schur functions. The answer is finally given as a sum over partitions of functions of the contents. One can also obtain alternative expressions involving hypergeometric functions of matrix arguments.',

	{'abstract': u'The Jordan algebra structure of the bounded real quantum observables was recognized already in the early days of quantum mechanics. While there are plausible reasons for most parts of this structure, the existence of the distributive nonassociative multiplication operation is hard to justify from a physical or statistical point of view. Considering the non-Boolean extension of classical probabilities, presented in a recent paper, it is shown in this paper that such a multiplication operation can be derived from certain properties of the conditional probabilities and the observables, i.e., from postulates with a clear statistical interpretation. The well-known close relation between Jordan operator algebras and C*-algebras then provides the connection to the quantum-mechanical Hilbert space formalism, thus resulting in a novel axiomatic approach to general quantum mechanics that includes the types II and III von Neumann algebras.',

	{'abstract': u'The so-called "replica method" of statistical physics is employed for the large system analysis of vector precoding for the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. The transmitter is assumed to comprise a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, that minimizes the front-end imposed transmit energy penalty. Focusing on discrete complex input alphabets, the energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet to a larger alphabet set prior to precoding. For the common discrete lattice-based relaxation, the problem is found to violate the assumption of replica symmetry and a replica symmetry breaking ansatz is taken. The limiting empirical distribution of the precoder\'s output, as well as the limiting energy penalty, are derived for one-step replica symmetry breaking. For convex relaxations, replica symmetry is found to hold and corresponding results are obtained for comparison. Particularizing to a "zero-forcing" (ZF) linear front-end, and non-cooperative users, a decoupling result is derived according to which the channel observed by each of the individual receivers can be effectively characterized by the Markov chain u-x-y, where u, x, and y are the channel input, the equivalent precoder output, and the channel output, respectively. For discrete lattice-based alphabet relaxation, the impact of replica symmetry breaking is demonstrated for the energy penalty at the transmitter. An analysis of spectral efficiency is provided to compare discrete lattice-based relaxations against convex relaxations, as well as linear ZF and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Focusing on quaternary phase shift-keying (QPSK), significant performance gains of both lattice and convex relaxations are revealed compared to linear ZF precoding, for medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). THP is shown to be outperformed as well.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper studies decentralized, Fountain and network-coding based strategies for facilitating data collection in circular wireless sensor networks, which rely on the stochastic diversity of data storage. The goal is to allow for a reduced delay collection by a data collector who accesses the network at a random position and random time. Data dissemination is performed by a set of relays which form a circular route to exchange source packets. The storage nodes within the transmission range of the route's relays linearly combine and store overheard relay transmissions using random decentralized strategies. An intelligent data collector first collects a minimum set of coded packets from a subset of storage nodes in its proximity, which might be sufficient for recovering the original packets and, by using a message-passing decoder, attempts recovering all original source packets from this set. Whenever the decoder stalls, the source packet which restarts decoding is polled/doped from its original source node. The random-walk-based analysis of the decoding/doping process furnishes the collection delay analysis with a prediction on the number of required doped packets. The number of doped packets can be surprisingly small when employed with an Ideal Soliton code degree distribution and, hence, the doping strategy may have the least collection delay when the density of source nodes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we demonstrate that network coding makes dissemination more efficient at the expense of a larger collection delay. Not surprisingly, a circular network allows for a significantly more (analytically and otherwise) tractable strategies relative to a network whose model is a random geometric graph.",

	{'abstract': u"We shall show how to decompose, by functorial and canonical fibrations, arbitrary -dimensional complex projective varieties into varieties (or rather ` geometric orbifolds rq of one of the three pure geometries determined by the `sign' (negative, zero, or positive) of the canonical bundle. These decompositions being birationally invariant, birational versions of these pure geometries, based on the canonical (or ` Kodaira rq dimension will be considered, rather. A crucial feature of these decompositions is indeed that, in order to deal with multiple fibres of fibrations, they need to take place in the larger category of `geometric orbifolds' . These are `virtual ramified covers' of varieties, which `virtually eliminate' multiple fibres of fibrations. Although formally the same as the `pairs' of the LMMP (see cite, cite, cite and the references there), they are here fully geometric objects equipped with the usual geometric invariants of varieties, such as sheaves of (symmetric) differential forms, fundamental group, Kobayashi pseudometric, integral points, morphisms and rational maps.

	{'abstract': u'Due to hardware and computational constraints, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) normally do not take measurements of time-of-arrival or time-difference-of-arrival for rangebased localization. Instead, WSNs in some applications use rangefree localization for simple but less accurate determination of sensor positions. A well-known algorithm for this purpose is the centroid algorithm. This paper presents a range-free localization technique based on the radical line of intersecting circles. This technique provides greater accuracy than the centroid algorithm, at the expense of a slight increase in computational load. Simulation results show that for the scenarios studied, the radical line method can give an approximately 2 to 30% increase in accuracy over the centroid algorithm, depending on whether or not the anchors have identical ranges, and on the value of DOI.',

At each step, with equal probability, either we pick a ball at random in and place it in , or vice-versa (provided of course that , or , is not empty). The number of balls in after steps is of order , and this number remains essentially the same after further steps. Observe that each ball in the urn after steps has a probability bounded away from and to be placed back in the urn after further steps. So, even though the number of balls in does not evolve significantly between and , the precise contain of urn does. This elementary observation is the source of an interesting two-time-scale phenomenon which we illustrate using a simple model of fragmentation-coagulation. Inspired by Pitman's construction of coalescing random forests, we consider for every a uniform random tree with vertices, and at each step, depending on the outcome of an independent fair coin tossing, either we remove one edge chosen uniformly at random amongst the remaining edges, or we replace one edge chosen uniformly at random amongst the edges which have been removed previously. The process that records the sizes of the tree-components evolves by fragmentation and coagulation.

	{'abstract': u'Wireless networks with multiple nodes that relay information from a source to a destination are expected to be deployed in many applications. Therefore, understanding their design and performance under practical constraints is important. In this work, we propose and study three multihopping decode and forward (MDF) protocols for multistage half-duplex relay networks with no direct link between the source and destination nodes. In all three protocols, we assume no cooperation across relay nodes for encoding and decoding. Numerical evaluation in illustrative example networks and comparison with cheap relay cut-set bounds for half-duplex networks show that the proposed MDF protocols approach capacity in some ranges of channel gains. The main idea in the design of the protocols is the use of coding in interference networks that are created in different states or modes of a half-duplex network. Our results suggest that multistage half-duplex relaying with practical constraints on cooperation is comparable to point-to-point links and full-duplex relay networks, if there are multiple non-overlapping paths from source to destination and if suitable coding is employed in interference network states.',

	{'abstract': u'A half-duplex wireless network with 6 lateral nodes, 3 transmitters and 3 receivers, and a central relay is considered. The transmitters wish to send information to their corresponding receivers via a two phase communication protocol. The receivers decode their desired messages by using side information and the signals received from the relay. We derive an outer bound on the capacity region of any two phase protocol as well as 3 achievable regions by employing different relaying strategies. In particular, we combine physical and network layer coding to take advantage of the interference at the relay, using, for example, lattice-based codes. We then specialize our results to the exchange rate. It is shown that for any snr, we can achieve within 0.5 bit of the upper bound by lattice coding and within 0.34 bit, if we take the best of the 3 strategies. Also, for high snr, lattice coding is within log(3)/4 ~ 0.4 bit of the upper bound.',

	{'abstract': u'Information-theoretic security -- widely accepted as the strictest notion of security -- relies on channel coding techniques that exploit the inherent randomness of the propagation channels to significantly strengthen the security of digital communications systems. Motivated by recent developments in the field, this paper aims at a characterization of the fundamental secrecy limits of wireless networks. Based on a general model in which legitimate nodes and potential eavesdroppers are randomly scattered in space, the intrinsically secure communications graph (iS-graph) is defined from the point of view of information-theoretic security. Conclusive results are provided for the local connectivity of the Poisson iS-graph, in terms of node degrees and isolation probabilities. It is shown how the secure connectivity of the network varies with the wireless propagation effects, the secrecy rate threshold of each link, and the noise powers of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers. Sectorized transmission and eavesdropper neutralization are explored as viable strategies for improving the secure connectivity. Lastly, the maximum secrecy rate between a node and each of its neighbours is characterized, and the case of colluding eavesdroppers is studied. The results help clarify how the spatial density of eavesdroppers can compromise the intrinsic security of wireless networks.',

A sequence of real numbers indexed by words in non-commuting variables with values invariant under cyclic permutations of the indexes, is called a tracial sequence. We prove that such a sequence can be represented with tracial moments of matrices if its corresponding moment matrix is positive semidefinite and of finite rank. A truncated tracial sequence allows for such a representation if and only if one of its extensions admits a flat extension. Finally, we apply the theory via duality to investigate trace-positive polynomials in non-commuting variables.',

Trees in this class can be generated by substitution processes. Their spectra are shown to be purely absolutely continuous and to consist of finitely many bands. The main result gives stability of absolutely continuous spectrum under sufficiently small radially label symmetric perturbations for non regular trees in this class. In sharp contrast, the absolutely continuous spectrum can be completely destroyed by arbitrary small radially label symmetric perturbations for regular trees in this class.',

	{'abstract': u"Using Hermite's formulation of polynomial stability conditions, static output feedback (SOF) controller design can be formulated as a polynomial matrix inequality (PMI), a (generally nonconvex) nonlinear semidefinite programming problem that can be solved (locally) with PENNON, an implementation of a penalty method. Typically, Hermite SOF PMI problems are badly scaled and experiments reveal that this has a negative impact on the overall performance of the solver. In this note we recall the algebraic interpretation of Hermite's quadratic form as a particular Bezoutian and we use results on polynomial interpolation to express the Hermite PMI in a Lagrange polynomial basis, as an alternative to the conventional power basis. Numerical experiments on benchmark problem instances show the substantial improvement brought by the approach, in terms of problem scaling, number of iterations and convergence behavior of PENNON.",

	{'abstract': u"Let Q be a finite quiver without oriented cycles, let Lambda be the associated preprojective algebra, let g be the associated Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Weyl group W, and let n be the positive part of g. For each Weyl group element w, a subcategory C_w of mod( Lambda) was introduced by Buan, Iyama, Reiten and Scott. It is known that C_w is a Frobenius category and that its stable category is a Calabi-Yau category of dimension two. We show that C_w yields a cluster algebra structure on the coordinate ring CC[N(w)] of the unipotent group N(w) := N cap (w^N_-w). Here N is the pro-unipotent pro-group with Lie algebra the completion of n. One can identify CC[N(w)] with a subalgebra of the graded dual of the universal enveloping algebra U(n) of n. Let S^* be the dual of Lusztig's semicanonical basis S of U(n). We show that all cluster monomials of CC[N(w)] belong to S^*, and that S^* cap CC[N(w)] is a basis of CC[N(w)]. Moreover, we show that the cluster algebra obtained from CC[N(w)] by formally inverting the generators of the coefficient ring is isomorphic to the algebra CC[N^w] of regular functions on the unipotent cell N^w := N cap (B_-wB_-) of the Kac-Moody group G with Lie algebra g. We obtain a corresponding dual semicanonical basis of CC[N^w]. As one application we obtain a basis for each acyclic cluster algebra, which contains all cluster monomials in a natural way.",

From this criterion, it follows that an action with a fixed point is polar if and only if the slice representation at the fixed point is polar and the section is the tangent space of an embedded totally geodesic submanifold.

Furthermore we study (infinite) rhombic embeddings in the plane which are quasicrystallic, that is they have only finitely many different edge directions. Bicoloring the vertices of the rhombi and adding circles with centers at vertices of one of the colors and radius equal to the edge length leads to isoradial quasicrystallic circle patterns. We prove for a large class of such circle patterns which cover the whole plane that they are uniquely determined up to affine transformations by the combinatorics and the intersection angles.

In this paper, we give a complete solution to the problem of existence and uniqueness of monotone waves in the KPP-Fisher equation. We show that each monotone traveling wave can be found via an iteration procedure. The proposed approach is based on the use of special monotone integral operators (which are different from the usual Wu-Zou operator) and appropriate upper and lower solutions associated to them. The analysis of the asymptotic expansions of the eventual traveling fronts at infinity is another key ingredient of our approach.",

We extend this notion to the lossy compression regime assuming a feedforward link is available, by modeling a source via a two-dimensional symbolic dynamical system where one component corresponds to the compressed signal, and the other essentially corresponds to the feedforward signal. For memoryless sources and an arbitrary bounded distortion measure, we show this approach leads to a family of simple deterministic compression schemes that attain the rate-distortion function of the source.

	{'abstract': u'Recent work has highlighted deep connections between sequence-length requirements for high-probability phylogeny reconstruction and the related problem of the estimation of ancestral sequences. In [Daskalakis et al.\'09], building on the work of [Mossel\'04], a tight sequence-length requirement was obtained for the CFN model. In particular the required sequence length for high-probability reconstruction was shown to undergo a sharp transition (from to , where is the number of leaves) at the "critical" branch length (if it exists) of the ancestral reconstruction problem. Here we consider the GTR model. For this model, recent results of [Roch\'09] show that the tree can be accurately reconstructed with sequences of length when the branch lengths are below , known as the Kesten-Stigum (KS) bound. Although for the CFN model , it is known that for the more general GTR models one has with a strict inequality in many cases. Here, we show that this phenomenon also holds for phylogenetic reconstruction by exhibiting a family of symmetric models and a phylogenetic reconstruction algorithm which recovers the tree from -length sequences for some branch lengths in the range . Second we prove that phylogenetic reconstruction under GTR models requires a polynomial sequence-length for branch lengths above .',

	{'abstract': u'Dirty paper coding (DPC) refers to methods for pre-subtraction of known interference at the transmitter of a multiuser communication system. There are numerous applications for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels. Recently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for DPC. In lattice-based DPC, there are two codes - a convolutional code that defines a lattice used for shaping and an error correction code used for channel coding. Several specific designs have been reported in the recent literature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching shaping and coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder works on a joint trellis of shaping and channel codes or the decoder requires iterations between the shaping and channel decoders. This results in high complexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC scheme that provides good shaping and coding gains with moderate complexity at both the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit shaping, and a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The crucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of the bits at the transmitter, which enable an LDPC decoder to be run first at the receiver. This provides gains without the need for iterations between the shaping and channel decoders. Simulation results confirm that at high rates the proposed DPC method performs close to capacity with moderate complexity. As an application of the proposed DPC method, we show a design for superposition coding that provides rates better than time-sharing over a Gaussian broadcast channel.',

We analyze the impact of the SNR imbalance between the BS-UE and RS-UE links, as well as the imperfect channel estimation at the UE receiver. The performance is analyzed in the presence of Rayleigh flat fading and our results show that the SNR imbalance does not impact the spatial diversity order.

	{'abstract': u'Orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras are fundamental symmetries in modern physics, such as massive supergravity. However, their representations are far from being thoroughly understood. In the present paper, we completely determine the structure of their various supersymmetric polynomial representations obtained by swapping bosonic multiplication operators and differential operators in the canonical supersymmetric polynomial representations. In particular, we obtain certain new infinite-dimensional irreducible representations and new composition series of indecomposable representations for these algebras.',

	{'abstract': u'- The main goal of this research is to develop the concept of an innovative processor system called Functional Processor System. The particular work carried out in this paper focuses on the execution of functions in the heterogeneous functional processor units(FPU) and integration of functions to bring net results. As the functional programs are super-level programs, the requirements of execution are only at functional level. The Execution and integration of results of functions in FPUs are a challenge. The methodology of executing the functions in the functional processor farm and the integration of results of functions according to the assigned addresses are investigated here. The concept of feeding the functions into the processor is promoted rather than the processor fetching the instructions/functions and executing in this paradigm. This work is carried out at conceptual levels and it takes a long way to go into the realization of this model in hardware, possibly only with a large industry team and with a realistic time frame.',

	{'abstract': u'We study optimal behavior of energy producers under a CO_2 emission abatement program. We focus on a two-player discrete-time model where each producer is sequentially optimizing her emission and production schedules. The game-theoretic aspect is captured through a reduced-form price-impact model for the CO_2 allowance price. Such duopolistic competition results in a new type of a non-zero-sum stochastic switching game on finite horizon. Existence of game Nash equilibria is established through generalization to randomized switching strategies. No uniqueness is possible and we therefore consider a variety of correlated equilibrium mechanisms. We prove existence of correlated equilibrium points in switching games and give a recursive description of equilibrium game values. A simulation-based algorithm to solve for the game values is constructed and a numerical example is presented.',

	{'abstract': u'Approximate message passing algorithms proved to be extremely effective in reconstructing sparse signals from a small number of incoherent linear measurements. Extensive numerical experiments further showed that their dynamics is accurately tracked by a simple one-dimensional iteration termed state evolution. In this paper we provide the first rigorous foundation to state evolution. We prove that indeed it holds asymptotically in the large system limit for sensing matrices with independent and identically distributed gaussian entries. While our focus is on message passing algorithms for compressed sensing, the analysis extends beyond this setting, to a general class of algorithms on dense graphs. In this context, state evolution plays the role that density evolution has for sparse graphs. The proof technique is fundamentally different from the standard approach to density evolution, in that it copes with large number of short loops in the underlying factor graph. It relies instead on a conditioning technique recently developed by Erwin Bolthausen in the context of spin glass theory.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a new class of quantized message-passing decoders for LDPC codes over the BSC. The messages take values (or levels) from a finite set. The update rules do not mimic belief propagation but instead are derived using the knowledge of trapping sets. We show that the update rules can be derived to correct certain error patterns that are uncorrectable by algorithms such as BP and min-sum. In some cases even with a small message set, these decoders can guarantee correction of a higher number of errors than BP and min-sum. We provide particularly good 3-bit decoders for 3-left-regular LDPC codes. They significantly outperform the BP and min-sum decoders, but more importantly, they achieve this at only a fraction of the complexity of the BP and min-sum decoders.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we show that the total Degrees-Of-Freedoms (DOF) of the -user Gaussian Interference Channel (GIC) can be achieved by incorporating a new alignment technique known as emph. This technique compared to its ancestor emph performs on a single real line and exploits the properties of real numbers to provide optimal signaling. The real interference alignment relies on a new coding scheme in which several data streams having fractional multiplexing gains are sent by transmitters and interfering streams are aligned at receivers. The coding scheme is backed up by a recent result in the field of Diophantine approximation, which states that the convergence part of the Khintchine-Groshev theorem holds for points on non-degenerate manifolds.',

	{'abstract': u'A popular theory of self-organized criticality relates the critical behavior of driven dissipative systems to that of systems with conservation. In particular, this theory predicts that the stationary density of the abelian sandpile model should be equal to the threshold density of the corresponding fixed-energy sandpile. This "density conjecture" has been proved for the underlying graph Z. We show (by simulation or by proof) that the density conjecture is false when the underlying graph is any of Z^2, the complete graph K_n, the Cayley tree, the ladder graph, the bracelet graph, or the flower graph. Driven dissipative sandpiles continue to evolve even after a constant fraction of the sand has been lost at the sink. These results cast doubt on the validity of using fixed-energy sandpiles to explore the critical behavior of the abelian sandpile model at stationarity.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the problem of securing a linear network coding system against an adversary that is both an eavesdropper and a jammer. The network is assumed to transport n packets from source to each receiver, and the adversary is allowed to eavesdrop on mu arbitrarily chosen links and also to inject up to t erroneous packets into the network. The goal of the system is to achieve zero-error communication that is information-theoretically secure from the adversary. Moreover, this goal must be attained in a universal fashion, i.e., regardless of the network topology or the underlying network code. An upper bound on the achievable rate under these requirements is shown to be n- mu-2t packets per transmission. A scheme is proposed that can achieve this maximum rate, for any n and any field size q, provided the packet length m is at least n symbols. The scheme is based on rank-metric codes and admits low-complexity encoding and decoding. In addition, the scheme is shown to be optimal in the sense that the required packet length is the smallest possible among all universal schemes that achieve the maximum rate.',

	{'abstract': u"The Steinitz class of a number field extension K/k is an ideal class in the ring of integers O_k of k, which, together with the degree [K:k] of the extension determines the O_k-module structure of O_K. We call R_t(k,G) the classes which are Steinitz classes of a tamely ramified G-extension of k. We will say that those classes are realizable for the group G; it is conjectured that the set of realizable classes is always a group. In this paper we will develop some of the ideas contained in arXiv:0910.5080 to study some l-groups, where l is an odd prime number. In particular, together with [1] we will complete the study of realizable Steinitz classes for groups of order l^3. We will also give an alternative proof of the results of [1], based on class field theory. [1] C. Bruche. Classes de Steinitz d'extensions non abeliennes de degre p^3.

	{'abstract': u"We consider collocated primary and secondary networks that have simultaneous access to the same frequency bands. Particularly, we examine three different levels at which primary and secondary networks may coexist: pure interference, asymmetric co-existence, and symmetric co-existence. At the asymmetric co-existence level, the secondary network selectively deactivates its users based on knowledge of the interference and channel gains, whereas at the symmetric level, the primary network also schedules its users in the same way. Our aim is to derive optimal sum-rates (i.e., throughputs)of both networks at each co-existence level as the number of users grows asymptotically and evaluate how the sum-rates scale with network size. In order to find the asymptotic throughput results, we derive a key lemma on extreme order statistics and a proposition on the sum of lower order statistics. As a baseline comparison, we calculate the sum-rates for channel sharing via time-division (TD). We compare the asymptotic secondary sum-rate in TD with that under simultaneous transmission, while ensuring the primary network maintains the same throughput in both cases. The results indicate that simultaneous transmission at both asymmetric and symmetric co-existence levels can outperform TD. Furthermore, this enhancement is achievable when uplink activation or deactivation of users is based only on the interference gains to the opposite network and not on a network's own channel gains.",

	{'abstract': u'A. Joseph invented multidegrees in [Jo84] to study orbital varieties, which are the components of an orbital scheme, itself constructed by intersecting a nilpotent orbit with a Borel subalgebra. Their multidegrees, known as Joseph polynomials, give a basis of a (Springer) representation of the Weyl group. In the case of the nilpotent orbit , the orbital varieties can be indexed by noncrossing chord diagrams in the disc. In this paper we study the normal cone to the orbital scheme inside this nilpotent orbit . This gives a better-motivated construction of the Brauer loop scheme we introduced in [KZJ07], whose components are indexed by all chord diagrams (now possibly with crossings) in the disc. The multidegrees of its components, the Brauer loop varieties, were shown to reproduce the ground state of the Brauer loop model in statistical mechanics [DFZJ06]. Here, we reformulate and slightly generalize these multidegrees in order to express them as solutions of the rational quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation associated to the Brauer algebra. In particular, the vector of the multidegrees satisfies two sets of equations, corresponding to the and generators of the Brauer algebra. We describe here the geometric meaning of both and equations in our slightly extended setting. We also describe the corresponding actions at the level of orbital varieties: while only the equations make sense directly on the Joseph polynomials, the equations also appear if one introduces a broader class of varieties. We explain the connection of the latter with matrix Schubert varieties.',

	{'abstract': u'A Kakutani-von Neumann map is the push-forward of the group rotation (Z_2,+1) to a unit simplex via an appropriate topological quotient. The usual quotient towards the unit interval is given by the base 2 expansion of real numbers, which in turn is induced by the doubling map. In this paper we replace the doubling map with an n-dimensional generalization of the tent map; this allows us to define Kakutani-von Neumann transformations in simplexes of arbitrary dimensions. The resulting maps are piecewise-linear bijections (not just mod 0 bijections), whose orbits are all uniformly distributed; in particular, they are uniquely ergodic w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. The forward orbit of a certain vertex provides an enumeration of all points in the simplex having dyadic coordinates, and this enumeration can be translated via the n-dimensional Minkowski function to an enumeration of all rational points. In the course of establishing the above results, we introduce a family of -valued functions, constituting an n-dimensional analogue of the classical Walsh functions.',

We prove the controllability of this system, in any positive time, locally around the ground state. Similar results were proved for particular models (by the first author and with J.M. Coron), in non optimal spaces, in long time and the proof relied on the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem in order to deal with an a priori loss of regularity. In this article, the model is more general, the spaces are optimal, there is no restriction on the time and the proof relies on the classical inverse mapping theorem. A hidden regularizing effect is emphasized, showing there is actually no loss of regularity. Then, the same strategy is applied to nonlinear Schr "odinger equations and nonlinear wave equations, showing that the method works for a wide range of bilinear control systems.',

Using the recent work of Boucksom-Chen we get a concave function on the Okounkov body whose law with respect to Lebesgue measure determines the asymptotic distribution of the weights of the test configuration. We show that this is a generalization of a well-known result in toric geometry. As an application, we prove that the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure on the Okounkov body is equal to a Duistermaat-Heckman measure of a certain deformation of the manifold. Via the Duisteraat-Heckman formula, we get as a corollary that in the special case of an effective -action on the manifold lifting to the line bundle, the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure on the Okounkov body is piecewise polynomial.',

	{'abstract': u'The Tikhonov regularization of linear ill-posed problems with an penalty is considered. We recall results for linear convergence rates and results on exact recovery of the support. Moreover, we derive conditions for exact support recovery which are especially applicable in the case of ill-posed problems, where other conditions, e.g. based on the so-called coherence or the restricted isometry property are usually not applicable. The obtained results also show that the regularized solutions do not only converge in the -norm but also in the vector space (when considered as the strict inductive limit of the spaces as tends to infinity). Additionally, the relations between different conditions for exact support recovery and linear convergence rates are investigated. With an imaging example from digital holography the applicability of the obtained results is illustrated, i.e. that one may check a priori if the experimental setup guarantees exact recovery with Tikhonov regularization with sparsity constraints.',

	{'abstract': u'The notion of causal boundary for a strongly causal spacetime has been a controversial topic along last decades: on one hand, some attempted definitions were not fully consistent, on the other, there were simple examples where an open conformal embedding could be defined, but the corresponding conformal boundary disagreed drastically with the causal one. Nevertheless, the recent progress in this topic suggests a definitive option for , which is developed here in detail. Our study has two parts: (I) To give general arguments on a boundary in order to ensure that it is admissible as a causal boundary at the three natural levels, i.e., as a point set, as a chronological space and as a topological space. Then, the essential uniqueness of our choice is stressed, and the relatively few admissible alternatives are discussed. (II) To analyze the role of the conformal boundary . We show that, in general, may present a very undesirable structure. Nevertheless, it is well-behaved under certain general assumptions, and its accessible part agrees with the causal boundary. This study justifies both boundaries. On one hand, the conformal boundary , which cannot be defined for a general spacetime but is easily computed in particular examples, appears now as a special case of the causal boundary. On the other, the new redefinition of the causal boundary not only is free of inconsistencies and applicable to any strongly causal spacetime, but also recovers the expected structure in the cases where a natural conformal boundary is available. The cases of globally hyperbolic spacetimes and asymptotically conformally flat ends are especially studied.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the stopping times of gossip algorithms for network coding. We analyze algebraic gossip (i.e., random linear coding) and consider three gossip algorithms for information spreading Pull, Push, and Exchange. The stopping time of algebraic gossip is known to be linear for the complete graph, but the question of determining a tight upper bound or lower bounds for general graphs is still open. We take a major step in solving this question, and prove that algebraic gossip on any graph of size n is O(D*n) where D is the maximum degree of the graph. This leads to a tight bound of Theta(n) for bounded degree graphs and an upper bound of O(n^2) for general graphs. We show that the latter bound is tight by providing an example of a graph with a stopping time of Omega(n^2). Our proofs use a novel method that relies on Jackson's queuing theorem to analyze the stopping time of network coding; this technique is likely to become useful for future research.",

	{'abstract': u'When a spatial process is recorded over time and the observation at a given time instant is viewed as a point in a function space, the result is a time series taking values in a Banach space. To study the spatio-temporal extremal dynamics of such a time series, the latter is assumed to be jointly regularly varying. This assumption is shown to be equivalent to convergence in distribution of the rescaled time series conditionally on the event that at a given moment in time it is far away from the origin. The limit is called the tail process or the spectral process depending on the way of rescaling. These processes provide convenient starting points to study, for instance, joint survival functions, tail dependence coefficients, extremograms, extremal indices, and point processes of extremes. The theory applies to linear processes composed of infinite sums of linearly transformed independent random elements whose common distribution is regularly varying.',

	{'abstract': u'Let E be a topological space and F a uniform space. We introduce a new topology (in fact a uniform structure) called the V-congergence on the space of applications from E to F such that C(E,F) is closed for this topology and the restriction of this topology to C(E,F) is equivalent to pointwise convergence. In other words this topology is the coarsest preserving continuity. We give a criterion of convergence for this topology not involving the limit. Among properties preserved are mesurability and alpha-borelianity for a countable ordinal alpha.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the geometry of the tower of Lubin-Tate deformation spaces, which parametrize deformations of a one-dimensional formal module of height h together with level structure. According to the conjecture of Deligne-Carayol, these spaces realize the local Langlands correspondence in their l-adic cohomology. This conjecture is now a theorem, but currently there is no purely local proof. Working in the equal characteristic case, we find a family of affinoids in the Lubin-Tate tower with good reduction equal to a rather curious nonsingular hypersurface, whose equation we present explicitly. Granting a conjecture on the L-functions of this hypersurface, we find a link between the conjecture of Deligne-Carayol and the theory of Bushnell-Kutzko types, at least for certain class of wildly ramified supercuspidal representations of small conductor.',

	{'abstract': u'We address the important question of the extent to which random variables and vectors with truncated power tails retain the characteristic features of random variables and vectors with power tails. We define two truncation regimes, soft truncation regime and hard truncation regime, and show that, in the soft truncation regime, truncated power tails behave, in important respects, as if no truncation took place. On the other hand, in the hard truncation regime much of "heavy tailedness" is lost. We show how to estimate consistently the tail exponent when the tails are truncated, and suggest statistical tests to decide on whether the truncation is soft or hard. Finally, we apply our methods to two recent data sets arising from computer networks.',

	{'abstract': u'It has been asserted previously by the author that optimal control theory can be a valuable framework for theoretical studies about the shape that a wind instrument should have in order to satisfy some optimization criterion, inside a fairly general class. The purpose of the present work is to develop this new approach with a look at a specific criterion to be optimized. In this setting, the Webster horn equation is regarded as a controlled dynamical equation in the space variable. Pressure is the state, the control being made of two parts: one variable part, the inside diameter of the duct and one constant part, the weights of the elementary time-harmonic components of the velocity potential. Then one looks for a control that optimizes a criterion related to the definition of an as the cooperation of several natural modes of vibration with the excitation, the being the one that maximizes the total generation of energy, as exposed by A.H. Benade, following H. Bouasse. At the same time the relevance of this criterion is questioned with the simulation results.',

	{'abstract': u'We define analytic torsion of Z_2-graded elliptic complexes as an element in the graded determinant line of the cohomology of the complex, generalizing most of the variants of Ray-Singer analytic torsion in the literature. It applies to a myriad of new examples, including flat superconnection complexes, twisted analytic and twisted holomorphic torsions, etc. The definition uses pseudo-differential operators and residue traces. We also study properties of analytic torsion for Z_2-graded elliptic complexes, including the behavior under variation of the metric. For compact odd dimensional manifolds, the analytic torsion is independent of the metric, whereas for even dimensional manifolds, a relative version of the analytic torsion is independent of the metric. Finally, the relation to topological field theories is studied.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of detecting whether or not, in a given sensor network, there is a cluster of sensors which exhibit an "unusual behavior." Formally, suppose we are given a set of nodes and attach a random variable to each node. We observe a realization of this process and want to decide between the following two hypotheses: under the null, the variables are i.i.d. standard normal; under the alternative, there is a cluster of variables that are i.i.d. normal with positive mean and unit variance, while the rest are i.i.d. standard normal. We also address surveillance settings where each sensor in the network collects information over time. The resulting model is similar, now with a time series attached to each node. We again observe the process over time and want to decide between the null, where all the variables are i.i.d. standard normal, and the alternative, where there is an emerging cluster of i.i.d. normal variables with positive mean and unit variance. The growth models used to represent the emerging cluster are quite general and, in particular, include cellular automata used in modeling epidemics. In both settings, we consider classes of clusters that are quite general, for which we obtain a lower bound on their respective minimax detection rate and show that some form of scan statistic, by far the most popular method in practice, achieves that same rate to within a logarithmic factor. Our results are not limited to the normal location model, but generalize to any one-parameter exponential family when the anomalous clusters are large enough.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider in this paper the design of full diversity and high rate space-time codes with moderate decoding complexity for arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas and arbitrary input alphabets. We focus our attention to codes from the threaded algebraic space-time (TAST) framework since the latter includes most known full diversity space-time codes. We propose a new construction of the component single-input single-output (SISO) encoders such that the equivalent code matrix has an upper triangular form. We accomplish this task by designing each SISO encoder to create an ISI-channel in each thread. This, in turn, greatly simplifies the QR-decomposition of the composite channel and code matrix, which is essential for optimal or near-optimal tree search algorithms, such as the sequential decoder.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by applications such as recommendation systems, we consider the estimation of a binary random field X obtained by row and column permutations of a block constant random matrix. The estimation of X is based on observations Y, which are obtained by passing entries of X through a binary symmetric channel (BSC) and an erasure channel. We focus on the analysis of a specific algorithm based on local popularity when the erasure rate approaches unity at a specified rate. We study the bit error rate (BER) in the limit as the matrix size approaches infinity. Our main result states that if the cluster size (that is, the size of the constancy blocks in the original matrix) is above a certain threshold, then the BER approaches zero, but below the threshold, the BER is lower bounded away from zero. The lower bound depends on the noise level in the observations and the size of the clusters in relation to the threshold. The threshold depends on the rate at which the erasure probability approaches unity.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a class of parametrizations of convex cones of positive semidefinite matrices with prescribed zeros. Each such cone corresponds to a graph whose non-edges determine the prescribed zeros. Each parametrization in this class is a polynomial map associated with a simplicial complex supported on cliques of the graph. The images of the maps are convex cones, and the maps can only be surjective onto the cone of zero-constrained positive semidefinite matrices when the associated graph is chordal and the simplicial complex is the clique complex of the graph. Our main result gives a semi-algebraic description of the image of the parametrizations for chordless cycles. The work is motivated by the fact that the considered maps correspond to Gaussian statistical models with hidden variables.',

	{'abstract': u'Collaborative beamforming (CB) is a power efficient method for data communications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which aims at increasing the transmission range in the network by radiating the power from a cluster of sensor nodes in the directions of the intended base station(s) or access point(s) (BSs/APs). The CB average beampattern expresses a deterministic behavior and can be used for characterizing/controling the transmission at intended direction(s), since the mainlobe of the CB beampattern is independent on the particular random node locations. However, the CB for a cluster formed by a limited number of collaborative nodes results in a sample beampattern with sidelobes that severely depend on the particular node locations. High level sidelobes can cause unacceptable interference when they occur at directions of unintended BSs/APs. Therefore, sidelobe control in CB has a potential to increase the network capacity and wireless channel availability by decreasing the interference. Traditional sidelobe control techniques are proposed for centralized antenna arrays and, therefore, are not suitable for WSNs. In this paper, we show that distributed, scalable, and low-complexity sidelobe control techniques suitable for CB in WSNs can be developed based on node selection technique which make use of the randomness of the node locations. A node selection algorithm with low-rate feedback is developed to search over different node combinations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in terms of the average number of trials required to select the collaborative nodes and the resulting interference. Our simulation results approve the theoretical analysis and show that the interference is significantly reduced when node selection is used with CB.',

	{'abstract': u'Groundwater flow in Washington DC greatly influences the surface water quality in urban areas. The current methods of flow estimation, based on Darcy\'s Law and the groundwater flow equation, can be described by the diffusion equation (the transient flow) and the Laplace equation (the steady-state flow). The Laplace equation is a simplification of the diffusion equation under the condition that the aquifer has a recharging boundary. The practical way of calculation is to use numerical methods to solve these equations. The most popular system is called MODFLOW, which was developed by USGS. MODFLOW is based on the finite-difference method in rectangular Cartesian coordinates. MODFLOW can be viewed as a "quasi 3D" simulation since it only deals with the vertical average (no z-direction derivative). Flow calculations between the 2D horizontal layers use the concept of leakage. In this project, we have established a mathematical model based on gradually varied functions for groundwater data volume reconstruction. These functions do not rely on the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system. A gradually varied function can be defined in a general graph or network. Gradually varied functions are suitable for arbitrarily shaped aquifers. Two types of models are designed and implemented for real data processing: (1) the gradually varied model for individual (time) groundwater flow data, (2) the gradually varied model for sequential (time) groundwater flow data. In application, we also established a MySQL database to support the related research. The advantage of the gradually varied fitting and its related method does not need the strictly defined boundary condition as it is required in MODFLOW.',

Focusing on the interference-power/interference-temperature (IT) constraint approach for CRs to protect primary radio transmissions, many new and challenging problems regarding the design of CR systems are formulated, and some of the corresponding solutions are shown to be obtainable by restructuring some classic results known for traditional (non-CR) wireless networks. It is demonstrated that convex optimization plays an essential role in solving these problems, in a both rigorous and efficient way. Promising research directions on interference management for CR and other related multiuser communication systems are discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'An -tuple of operators acting on a Hilbert space is said to be isometric if the operator is an isometry. We prove a decomposition for an isometric tuple of operators that generalizes the classical Lebesgue-von Neumann-Wold decomposition of an isometry into the direct sum of a unilateral shift, an absolutely continuous unitary and a singular unitary. We show that, as in the classical case, this decomposition determines the weakly closed algebra and the von Neumann algebra generated by the tuple.',

	{'abstract': u'Based on a stochastic geometry framework, we establish an analysis of the multi-hop spatial reuse aloha protocol (MSR-Aloha) in ad hoc networks. We compare MSR-Aloha to a simple routing strategy, where a node selects the next relay of the treated packet as to be its nearest receiver with a forward progress toward the final destination (NFP). In addition, performance gains achieved by employing adaptive antenna array systems are quantified in this paper. We derive a tight upper bound on the spatial density of progress of MSR-Aloha. Our analytical results demonstrate that the spatial density of progress scales as the square root of the density of users, and the optimal contention density (that maximizes the spatial density of progress) is independent of the density of users. These two facts are consistent with the observations of Baccelli et al., established through an analytical lower bound and through simulations.',

These important classes of posets are related to the theory of generating functions and to geometry. The results of this paper are organized as follows: We completely determine the structure of Eulerian binomial posets and, as a conclusion, we are able to classify factorial functions of Eulerian binomial posets; We give an almost complete classification of factorial functions of Eulerian Sheffer posets by dividing the original question into several cases; In most cases above, we completely determine the structure of Eulerian Sheffer posets, a result stronger than just classifying factorial functions of these Eulerian Sheffer posets. We also study Eulerian triangular posets. This paper answers questions asked by R. Ehrenborg and M. Readdy. This research is also motivated by the work of R. Stanley about recognizing the boolean lattice by looking at smaller intervals.',

	{'abstract': u'A distributed detection problem over fading Gaussian multiple-access channels is considered. Sensors observe a phenomenon and transmit their observations to a fusion center using the amplify and forward scheme. The fusion center has multiple antennas with different channel models considered between the sensors and the fusion center, and different cases of channel state information are assumed at the sensors. The performance is evaluated in terms of the error exponent for each of these cases, where the effect of multiple antennas at the fusion center is studied. It is shown that for zero-mean channels between the sensors and the fusion center when there is no channel information at the sensors, arbitrarily large gains in the error exponent can be obtained with sufficient increase in the number of antennas at the fusion center. In stark contrast, when there is channel information at the sensors, the gain in error exponent due to having multiple antennas at the fusion center is shown to be no more than a factor of (8/pi) for Rayleigh fading channels between the sensors and the fusion center, independent of the number of antennas at the fusion center, or correlation among noise samples across sensors. Scaling laws for such gains are also provided when both sensors and antennas are increased simultaneously. Simple practical schemes and a numerical method using semidefinite relaxation techniques are presented that utilize the limited possible gains available. Simulations are used to establish the accuracy of the results.',

We first generate encoded symbols (from the file) which are then distributed among the nodes. We investigate the optimal allocation of encoded packets to the storage nodes such that the probability of reconstructing the file by using any out of nodes is maximized. Since the optimal allocation of encoded packets is difficult to find in general, we find another objective function which well approximates the original problem and yet is easier to optimize. We find the optimal symmetric allocation for all coding redundancy constraints using the equivalent approximate problem. We also investigate the optimal allocation in random graphs.

	{'abstract': u'Recently Verdu and Weissman introduced erasure entropies, which are meant to measure the information carried by one or more symbols given all of the remaining symbols in the realization of the random process or field. A natural relation to Gibbs measures has also been observed. In his short note we study this relation further, review a few earlier contributions from statistical mechanics, and provide the formula for the erasure entropy of a Gibbs measure in terms of the corresponding potentia. For some 2-dimensonal Ising models, for which Verdu and Weissman suggested a numerical procedure, we show how to obtain an exact formula for the erasure entropy. l',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers minimum sum mean-squared error (sum-MSE) linear transceiver designs in multiuser downlink systems with imperfect channel state information. Specifically, we derive the optimal energy allocations for training and data phases for such a system. Under MMSE estimation of uncorrelated Rayleigh block fading channels with equal average powers, we prove the separability of the energy allocation and transceiver design optimization problems. A closed-form optimum energy allocation is derived and applied to existing transceiver designs. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate the improvements that can be realized with the proposed design.',

We ensure that the dirt in our scheme remains distinguishable to the receiver and thus, our designed scheme is applicable to broadcast channel. Following Costa's idea, we recognize the criteria that the transmit signal must be as orthogonal to the dirt as possible. Finite constellation codes are constructed using trellis coded modulation and by using a Viterbi algorithm at the encoder so that the code satisfies the design criteria and simulation results are presented with codes constructed via trellis coded modulation using QAM signal sets to illustrate our results.",

	{'abstract': u'In this contribution, an algorithm for evaluating the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for frequency selective Rayleigh MIMO channels is proposed. In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh cases, no closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are available. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed numerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain computationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize (w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the average mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. An algorithm based on an iterative water filling scheme is proposed, and its convergence is studied. Numerical simulation results show that, even for a moderate number of transmit and receive antennas, the new approach provides the same results as direct maximization approaches of the average mutual information.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper concerns the construction of tests for universal hypothesis testing problems, in which the alternate hypothesis is poorly modeled and the observation space is large. The mismatched universal test is a feature-based technique for this purpose. In prior work it is shown that its finite-observation performance can be much better than the (optimal) Hoeffding test, and good performance depends crucially on the choice of features. The contributions of this paper include: 1) We obtain bounds on the number of epsilon distinguishable distributions in an exponential family. 2) This motivates a new framework for feature extraction, cast as a rank-constrained optimization problem. 3) We obtain a gradient-based algorithm to solve the rank-constrained optimization problem and prove its local convergence.',

This fundamental result has many applications, one of the most important is to the estimates of the generic number of Mather measures. Ma ~n \'e obtained the first estimation of that sort by using finite dimensional approximations. Recently, we were able with Gonzalo Contreras to use this method of finite dimensional approximation in order to solve a conjecture of John Mather concerning the generic number of Mather measures for families of Lagrangian systems. In the present paper we obtain finer results in that direction by applying directly some classical tools of convex analysis to the infinite dimensional problem. We use a notion of countably rectifiable sets of finite codimension in Banach (and Frechet) spaces which may deserve independent interest.',

It is well known that A(R) is intimately related to Gorenstein projective modules, and our main result is that A^s(R) is similarly related to what can reasonably be called Gorenstein projective homomorphisms. Namely, there is an equivalence of triangulated categories: underline(R) --&gt; A^s(R) / K^b(Prj R). Here underline(R) is the stable category of Gorenstein projective objects in the abelian category Mor(R) of homomorphisms of R-modules, and K^b(Prj R) is the homotopy category of bounded complexes of projective R-modules. This result is set in the wider context of a theory for A^s(R) and B^s(R), the symmetric Bass category which is defined dually.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we use a design theoretical approach to construct new, previously unknown complex Hadamard matrices. Our methods generalize and extend the earlier results of de la Harpe--Jones and Munemasa--Watatani and offer a theoretical explanation for the existence of some sporadic examples of complex Hadamard matrices in the existing literature. As it is increasingly difficult to distinguish inequivalent matrices from each other, we propose a new invariant, the fingerprint of complex Hadamard matrices. As a side result, we refute a conjecture of Koukouvinos et al. on (n-8)x(n-8) minors of real Hadamard matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'The Banzhaf power index was introduced in cooperative game theory to measure the real power of players in a game. The Banzhaf interaction index was then proposed to measure the interaction degree inside coalitions of players. It was shown that the power and interaction indexes can be obtained as solutions of a standard least squares approximation problem for pseudo-Boolean functions. Considering certain weighted versions of this approximation problem, we define a class of weighted interaction indexes that generalize the Banzhaf interaction index. We show that these indexes define a subclass of the family of probabilistic interaction indexes and study their most important properties. Finally, we give an interpretation of the Banzhaf and Shapley interaction indexes as centers of mass of this subclass of interaction indexes.',

For a suitable choice of control policies, we show that the finite-horizon optimization problem to be solved on-line is convex and successively feasible. Due to the inherent nonlinearity of the feedback loop, a slight extension of the Kalman filter is exploited to estimate the state optimally in mean-square sense. We show that the receding horizon implementation of the resulting control policies renders the state of the overall system mean-square bounded under mild assumptions. Finally, we discuss how some of the quantities required by the finite-horizon optimization problem can be computed off-line, reducing the on-line computation, and present some numerical examples.',

The well-posedness of the direct problem is established, employing the integral equation method.

Then, using the idea developed by Liu and Zhang [21], a new mixed reciprocity relation is obtained and used to show that the impenetrable obstacle with its physical property can also be recovered.

	{'abstract': u'This paper is devoted to the study of mean-field limit for systems of indistinguables particles undergoing collision processes. As formulated by Kac cite this limit is based on the , and we (1) prove and quantify this property for Boltzmann collision processes with unbounded collision rates (hard spheres or long-range interactions), (2) prove and quantify this property emph. This yields the first chaos propagation result for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for true (without cut-off) Maxwell molecules whose "Master equation" shares similarities with the one of a L \'evy process and the first chaos propagation result for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for hard spheres (improvement of the %non-contructive convergence result of Sznitman cite). Moreover our chaos propagation results are the first uniform in time ones for Boltzmann collision processes (to our knowledge), which partly answers the important question raised by Kac of relating the long-time behavior of a particle system with the one of its mean-field limit, and we provide as a surprising application a new proof of the well-known result of gaussian limit of rescaled marginals of uniform measure on the -dimensional sphere as goes to infinity (more applications will be provided in a forthcoming work). Our results are based on a new method which reduces the question of chaos propagation to the one of proving a purely functional estimate on some generator operators () together with fine stability estimates on the flow of the limiting non-linear equation ().',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the Laplace-Beltrami operator in tubular neighbourhoods of curves on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, subject to non-Hermitian parity and time preserving boundary conditions. We are interested in the interplay between the geometry and spectrum. After introducing a suitable Hilbert space framework in the general situation, which enables us to realize the Laplace-Beltrami operator as an m-sectorial operator, we focus on solvable models defined on manifolds of constant curvature. In some situations, notably for non-Hermitian Robin-type boundary conditions, we are able to prove either the reality of the spectrum or the existence of complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues, and establish similarity of the non-Hermitian m-sectorial operators to normal or self-adjoint operators. The study is illustrated by numerical computations.',

In general, this volume is infinite; however, the (d-1)-volume and covering numbers of a filtered medial axis (the mu-medial axis) that is at distance greater than R from the compact set will be explicitely bounded. The behaviour of the bound we obtain with respect to mu, R and the covering numbers of the compact set K are optimal. From this result we deduce that the projection function on a compact subset K of the Euclidean d-space depends continuously on the compact set K, in the L^1 sense.

We propose a robust noisy limited feedback design for SDMA systems. The solution consists of a real-time robust SDMA precoding, user selection and rate adaptation as well as an offline feedback index assignment algorithm. The index assignment problem is cast into a Traveling Sales Man problem (TSP). Based on the specific structure of the feedback constellation and the precoder, we derive a low complex but asymptotically optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed framework has significant goodput gain compared to the traditional naive designs under noisy limited feedback channel. Furthermore, we show that despite the noisy feedback channel, the average SDMA system goodput grows with the number of feedback bits in the interference limited regime while in noise limited regime increases linearly with the number of transmit antenna and the forward channel SNR.',

Moreover, achievable rates based on the compress-and-forward transmission strategy are presented using rate-distortion and Wyner-Ziv compression schemes. It is observed that when the relay is close to the source, decode-and-forward is almost optimal, whereas compress-and-forward achieves good performance when the relay is close to the destination.',

	{'abstract': u'Inertia-gravity mode and Rossby mode dispersion properties are examined for discretisations of the linearized rotating shallow-water equations using the - finite element pair on arbitrary triangulations in planar geometry. A discrete Helmholtz decomposition of the functions in the velocity space based on potentials taken from the pressure space is used to provide a complete description of the numerical wave propagation for the discretised equations. In the -plane case, this decomposition is used to obtain decoupled equations for the geostrophic modes, the inertia-gravity modes, and the inertial oscillations. As has been noticed previously, the geostrophic modes are steady. The Helmholtz decomposition is used to show that the resulting inertia-gravity wave equation is third-order accurate in space. In general the pdgp finite element pair is second-order accurate, so this leads to very accurate wave propagation. It is further shown that the only spurious modes supported by this discretisation are spurious inertial oscillations which have frequency , and which do not propagate. The Helmholtz decomposition also allows a simple derivation of the quasi-geostrophic limit of the discretised - equations in the -plane case, resulting in a Rossby wave equation which is also third-order accurate.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper describes limiting behaviour of tail empirical process associated with long memory stochastic volatility models. We show that such process has dichotomous behaviour, according to an interplay between a Hurst parameter and a tail index. In particular, the limit may be non-Gaussian and/or degenerate, indicating an influence of long memory. On the other hand, tail empirical process with random levels never suffers from long memory. This is very desirable from a practical point of view, since such the process may be used to construct Hill estimator of the tail index. To prove our results we need to establish several new results for regularly varying distribution functions, which may be of independent interest.',

	{'abstract': u"For every Gaussian relay network with a single source-destination pair, it is known that there exists a corresponding deterministic network called the discrete superposition network that approximates its capacity uniformly over all SNR's to within a bounded number of bits. The next step in this program of rigorous approximation is to determine whether coding schemes for discrete superposition models can be lifted to Gaussian relay networks with a bounded rate loss independent of SNR. We establish precisely this property and show that the superposition model can thus serve as a strong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks. We show that a code for a Gaussian relay network, with a single source-destination pair and multiple relay nodes, can be designed from any code for the corresponding discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. In comparison to the rate of the discrete superposition network's code, the rate of the Gaussian network's code only reduces at most by a constant that is a function only of the number of nodes in the network and independent of channel gains. This result is also applicable for coding schemes for MIMO Gaussian relay networks, with the reduction depending additionally on the number of antennas. Hence, the discrete superposition model can serve as a digital interface for operating Gaussian relay networks.",

In this work we derive upper and lower bounds for H(lambda) that are asymptotically tight and easy to compute. The derivation of such bounds involves only simple probabilistic and analytic tools. This complements the asymptotic expansions of Knessl (1998), Jacquet and Szpankowski (1999), and Flajolet (1999). The same method yields tight bounds on the relative entropy D(n, p) between a binomial and a Poisson, thus refining the work of Harremoes and Ruzankin (2004). Bounds on the entropy of the binomial also follow easily.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we introduce the Causal Cognitive Interference Channel With Delay (CC-IFC-WD) in which the cognitive user transmission can depend on future received symbols as well as the past ones. Taking the effect of the link delays into account, CC-IFC-WD fills the gap between the genie-aided and causal 1cognitive radio channels. We study three special cases: 1) Classical CC-IFC (L=0), 2) CC-IFC without delay (L=1) and 3) CC-IFC with a block length delay (L=n). In each case, we obtain an inner bound on the capacity region. Our coding schemes make use of cooperative strategy by generalized block Markov superposition coding, collaborative strategy by rate splitting, and Gel'fand-Pinsker coding in order to pre-cancel part of the interference. Moreover, instantaneous relaying and non-causal partial Decode-and-Forward strategies are employed in the second and third cases, respectively. The derived regions under special conditions, reduce to several previously known results. Moreover, we show that the coding strategy which we use to derive achievable rate region for the classical CC-IFC achieves capacity for a special case of this channel. Furthermore, we extend our achievable rate regions to Gaussian case. Providing a numerical example for Gaussian CC-IFC-WD, we investigate the rate gain of the cognitive link for different delay values.",

	{'abstract': u'Let M be a U(1) bundle over a smooth Riemann surface. I show that for Chern-Simons theory on M, with structure group G, the path integral is an integral over the space of G-connections on the Riemann surface involving characteristic classes as well as a certain 4-dimensional class that comes from a universal bundle. When M is the product of a Riemann surface with a circle the 4-dimensional class does not enter and the path integral takes the form of a Riemann-Roch formula albeit in infinite dimensions. The discussion is generalised to include Wilson lines along the fibre direction in M.',

We also, under certain hypothesis recover the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure estimates for the usual 3D Navier-Stokes equations with potential force. Moreover, we show that the estimates depend on l, this result suggests that the modified Navier Stokes system is successful model of turbulence and the size of the nodal set leads the way for developing the turbulence theory.',

This new model has the same accuracy as the standard Green-Naghdi equations. Its mathematical interest is that it allows a control of the rotational part of the (vertically averaged) horizontal velocity, which is not the case for the usual Green-Naghdi equations. Using this property, we show that the solution of these new equations can be constructed by a standard Picard iterative scheme so that there is no loss of regularity of the solution with respect to the initial condition. Finally, we prove that the new Green-Naghdi equations conserve the almost irrotationality of the vertically averaged horizontal component of the velocity.',

This notion generalizes various notions of quadratic maps between algebraic objects in the literature. We construct a category of quadratic maps between -modules and show that it is a right-quadratic category and has an internal Hom-functor. Along our way, we recall the notions of a general square ring and of a module over , and discuss their elementary properties in some detail, adopting an operadic point of view. In particular, it turns out that the associated graded object of a square ring is a nilpotent operad of class 2, and the associated graded object of an -module is an algebra over this operad, in a functorial way. This generalizes the well-known relation between groups and graded Lie algebras (in the case of nilpotency class 2). We also generalize some elementary notions from group theory to modules over square rings.',

The approach is based on the evolution of shock particles, separated by local similarity solutions. The numerical solution is defined everywhere, and is as accurate as the applied ODE solver. Furthermore, the method is extended to stiff balance laws. A special correction approach yields a method that evolves detonation waves at correct velocities, without resolving their internal dynamics. The particle approach is compared to a classical finite volume method in terms of numerical accuracy, both for conservation laws and for an application in reaction kinetics.',

	{'abstract': u'A natural formulation of the theory of quantum measurements in continuous time is based on quantum stochastic differential equations (Hudson-Parthasarathy equations). However, such a theory was developed only in the case of Hudson-Parthasarathy equations with bounded coefficients. By using some results on Hudson-Parthasarathy equations with unbounded coefficients, we are able to extend the theory of quantum continuous measurements to cases in which unbounded operators on the system space are involved. A significant example of a quantum optical system (the degenerate parametric oscillator) is shown to fulfill the hypotheses introduced in the general theory.',

The coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of an I-admissible filtration A is called the Chern number of A. The Positivity Conjecture of Vasconcelos for the Chern number of the integral closure filtration is proved for a 2-dimensional complete local domain and more generally for any analytically unramified local ring R whose integral closure in its total ring of fractions is Cohen-Macaulay as an R-module. It is proved that if I is a parameter ideal then the Chern number of the I-adic filtration is non-negative.

	{'abstract': u"The face ring of a simplicial complex modulo m generic linear forms is shown to have finite local cohomology if and only if the link of every face of dimension m or more is `nonsingular', i.e., has the homology of a wedge of spheres of the expected dimension. This is derived from an enumerative result for local cohomology of face rings modulo generic linear forms, as compared with local cohomology of the face ring itself. The enumerative result is generalized in slightly weaker form to squarefree modules. A concept of `Cohen-Macaulay in codimension c' is defined and characterized for arbitrary finitely generated modules and coherent sheaves. For the face ring of an r-dimensional complex Delta, it is equivalent to nonsingularity of Delta in dimension r-c; for a coherent sheaf on projective space, this condition is shown to be equivalent to the same condition on any single generic hyperplane section. The characterization of nonsingularity in dimension m via finite local cohomology thus generalizes from face rings to arbitrary graded modules.",

The transmitter has two independent, confidential messages and a common message. Each of the confidential messages is intended for one of the receivers but needs to be kept perfectly secret from the other, and the common message is intended for both receivers. It is shown that a natural scheme that combines secret dirty-paper coding with Gaussian superposition coding achieves the secrecy capacity region. To prove this result, a channel-enhancement approach and an extremal entropy inequality of Weingarten et al. are used.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of source coding with side information (SCSI) is closely related to channel coding. Therefore, existing literature focuses on using the most successful channel codes namely, LDPC codes, turbo codes, and their variants, to solve this problem assuming classical unique decoding of the underlying channel code. In this paper, in contrast to classical decoding, we have taken the list decoding approach. We show that syndrome source coding using list decoding can achieve the theoretical limit. We argue that, as opposed to channel coding, the correct sequence from the list produced by the list decoder can effectively be recovered in case of SCSI, since we are dealing with a virtual noisy channel rather than a real noisy channel. Finally, we present a guideline for designing constructive SCSI schemes using Reed Solomon code, BCH code, and Reed-Muller code, which are the known list-decodable codes.',

	{'abstract': u'For finitely generated groups, amenability and Flner properties are equivalent. However, contrary to a widespread idea, Kaimanovich showed that Flner condition does not imply amenability for discrete measured equivalence relations. In this paper, we exhibit two examples of foliations of closed manifolds that are Flner and non amenable with respect to a finite transverse invariant measure and a transverse invariant volume, respectively. We also prove the equivalence between the two notions when the foliation is minimal, that is all the leaves are dense, giving a positive answer to a question of Kaimanovich. The equivalence is stated with respect to transverse invarian measures or some tangentially smooth measures. The latter include harmonic measures, and in this case the Flner condition has to be replaced by -Flner (where the usual volume is modified by the modular form of the measure).',

Yet, the question remained whether more messages can strictly improve the sum-rate-distortion function. Viewing the sum-rate as a functional of the distortions and the joint source distribution and leveraging its convex-geometric properties, we construct an example which shows that two messages can strictly improve the one-message (Wyner-Ziv) rate-distortion function.

	{'abstract': u"This article studies an infinite dimensional analog of Milstein's scheme for finite dimensional stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs). The Milstein scheme is known to be impressively efficient for SODEs which fulfill a certain commutativity type condition. This article introduces the infinite dimensional analog of this commutativity type condition and observes that a certain class of semilinear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDEs) with multiplicative trace class noise naturally fulfills the resulting infinite dimensional commutativity condition. In particular, a suitable infinite dimensional analog of Milstein's algorithm can be simulated efficiently for such SPDEs and requires less computational operations and random variables than previously considered algorithms for simulating such SPDEs. The analysis is supported by numerical results for a stochastic heat equation and stochastic reaction diffusion equations showing signifficant computational savings.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider 1-dimensional, unimodular Pisot substitution tilings with three intervals, and discuss conditions under which pairs of such tilings are locally isomorhphic (LI), or mutually locally derivable (MDL). For this purpose, we regard the substitutions as homomorphisms of the underlying free group with three generators. Then, if two substitutions are conjugated by an inner automorphism of the free group, the two tilings are LI, and a conjugating outer automorphism between two substitutions can often be used to prove that the two tilings are MLD. We present several examples illustrating the different phenomena that can occur in this context. In particular, we show how two substitution tilings can be MLD even if their substitution matrices are not equal, but only conjugate in . We also illustrate how the (in our case fractal) windows of MLD tilings can be reconstructed from each other, and discuss how the conjugating group automorphism affects the substitution generating the window boundaries.',

Assume one samples m Hermitian matrices X_1, ..., X_m with replacement from a finite collection. The deviation of the sum X_1+...+X_m from its expected value in terms of the operator norm can be estimated by an "operator Chernoff-bound" due to Ahlswede and Winter. The question arose whether the bounds obtained this way continue to hold if the matrices are sampled without replacement. We remark that a positive answer is implied by a classical argument by Hoeffding. Some consequences for the matrix recovery problem are sketched.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the virtual geometry of the moduli spaces of curves and sheaves on K3 surfaces in primitive classes. Equivalences relating the reduced Gromov-Witten invariants of K3 surfaces to characteristic numbers of stable pairs moduli spaces are proven. As a consequence, we prove the Katz-Klemm-Vafa conjecture evaluating integrals (in all genera) in terms of explicit modular forms. Indeed, all K3 invariants in primitive classes are shown to be governed by modular forms. The method of proof is by degeneration to elliptically fibered rational surfaces. New formulas relating reduced virtual classes on K3 surfaces to standard virtual classes after degeneration are needed for both maps and sheaves. We also prove a Gromov-Witten/Pairs correspondence for toric 3-folds. Our approach uses a result of Kiem and Li to produce reduced classes. In Appendix A, we answer a number of questions about the relationship between the Kiem-Li approach, traditional virtual cycles, and symmetric obstruction theories.

	{'abstract': u'The concept of effective complexity of an object as the minimal description length of its regularities has been initiated by Gell-Mann and Lloyd. The regularities are modeled by means of ensembles, that is probability distributions on finite binary strings. In our previous paper we propose a definition of effective complexity in precise terms of algorithmic information theory. Here we investigate the effective complexity of binary strings generated by stationary, in general not computable, processes. We show that under not too strong conditions long typical process realizations are effectively simple. Our results become most transparent in the context of coarse effective complexity which is a modification of the original notion of effective complexity that uses less parameters in its definition. A similar modification of the related concept of sophistication has been suggested by Antunes and Fortnow.',

CT-CDMA is one of the communication systems based on complete complementary codes. In this system, the information data of the multiple users can be transmitted by using the same set of complementary codes through a single frequency band.

We give two frameworks of supersymmetric C*-dynamical systems. `The supersymmetric dynamics for Case (I)' is intended for exact supersymmetry hidden in fermion lattice systems, while `the supersymmetric dynamics for Case (II)' is intended for supersymmetric quantum field theory. We study each of them with particular emphasis on the domain of superderivations. We discuss realization of supersymmetric dynamics by using the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction. We establish an exact supersymmetry formula upon the GNS Hilbert space for an arbitrary (regular) supersymmetric state. We define a class of C*-dynamics on the CAR algebra modeling supersymmetric fermion lattice models (without boson fields). This provides concrete examples for the supersymmetric dynamics for Case (I). We prove that superderivations on the fermion lattice system are closable (under unbroken supersymmetry). We obtain a general condition for nilpotency of superderivations on the fermion lattice system. The axioms of the supersymmetric dynamics for Case (II) are based on the supersymmetry model by Buchholz-Grundling. However, the required supersymmetry formula given here is stronger than its original.",

Moreover, we prove that such a local boundedness estimate for weak solutions of the system is equivalent to the usual global pointwise bound for the Green's matrix. In the scalar case, such an estimate is a consequence of De Giorgi-Moser-Nash theory and holds for equations with bounded measurable coefficients in arbitrary domains. In the vectorial case, one need to impose certain assumptions on the coefficients of the system as well as on domains to obtain such an estimate.

	{'abstract': u"We consider a general multi-agent convex optimization problem where the agents are to collectively minimize a global objective function subject to a global inequality constraint, a global equality constraint, and a global constraint set. The objective function is defined by a sum of local objective functions, while the global constraint set is produced by the intersection of local constraint sets. In particular, we study two cases: one where the equality constraint is absent, and the other where the local constraint sets are identical. We devise two distributed primal-dual subgradient algorithms which are based on the characterization of the primal-dual optimal solutions as the saddle points of the Lagrangian and penalty functions. These algorithms can be implemented over networks with changing topologies but satisfying a standard connectivity property, and allow the agents to asymptotically agree on optimal solutions and optimal values of the optimization problem under the Slater's condition.",

We provide the closed-form expression of optimum asymptotic expected EED comprised of the optimum distortion exponent and the multiplicative optimum distortion factor for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown that frequency diversity can improve EED though it has no effect on ergodic capacity. The improvement becomes slight when the frequency diversity order is greater than a certain number. The lower bounds related to infinite frequency diversity are derived. The results for outage-free systems are the bounds for outage-suffering systems and they are instructive for system design.',

	{'abstract': u'In interference alignment, users sharing a wireless channel are each able to achieve data rates of up to half of the non-interfering channel capacity, no matter the number of users. In an ergodic setting, this is achieved by pairing complementary channel realizations in order to amplify signals and cancel interference. However, this scheme has the possibility for large delays in decoding message symbols. We show that delay can be mitigated by using outputs from potentially more than two channel realizations, although data rate may be reduced. We further demonstrate the tradeoff between rate and delay via a time-sharing strategy. Our analysis considers Gaussian channels; an extension to finite field channels is also possible.',

The conjectures also predict that this basis controls numerics of representations of the Lie algebra of a semi-simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. We check this for almost all characteristics. To this end we construct a non-commutative resolution of the nilpotent cone which is derived equivalent to the Springer resolution. On the one hand, this noncommutative resolution is shown to be compatible with the positive characteristic version of Beilinson-Bernstein localization equivalences. On the other hand, it is compatible with the t-structure arising from the equivalence of Arkhipov-Bezrukavnikov with the derived category of perverse sheaves on the affine flag variety of the Langlands dual group, which was inspired by local geometric Langlands duality. This allows one to apply Frobenius purity theorem to deduce the desired properties of the basis. We expect the noncommutative counterpart of the Springer resolution to be of independent interest from the perspectives of algebraic geometry and geometric Langlands duality.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the spectrum of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian for small values of the coupling constant. It is known that this set is a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure. Here we study the limit, as the value of the coupling constant approaches zero, of its thickness and its Hausdorff dimension. We prove that the thickness tends to infinity and, consequently, the Hausdorff dimension of the spectrum tends to one. We also show that at small coupling, all gaps allowed by the gap labeling theorem are open and the length of every gap tends to zero linearly. Moreover, for sufficiently small coupling, the sum of the spectrum with itself is an interval. This last result provides a rigorous explanation of a phenomenon for the Fibonacci square lattice discovered numerically by Even-Dar Mandel and Lifshitz. Finally, we provide explicit upper and lower bounds for the solutions to the difference equation and use them to study the spectral measures and the transport exponents.',

	{'abstract': u'Decimal expansions of classical constants such as , and have long been a source of difficult questions. In the case of Laurent series with coefficients in a finite field, where no carry-over difficulties appear, the situation seems to be simplified and drastically different. On the other hand, Carlitz introduced analogs of real numbers such as , or . Hence, it became reasonable to enquire how "complex" the Laurent representation of these "numbers" is. In this paper we prove that the inverse of Carlitz\'s analog of , , has in general a linear complexity, except in the case , when the complexity is quadratic. In particular, this implies the transcendence of over . In the second part, we consider the classes of Laurent series of at most polynomial complexity and of zero entropy. We show that these satisfy some nice closure properties.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of zero error source coding with limited feedback when side information is present at the receiver. First, we derive an achievable rate region for arbitrary joint distributions on the source and the side information. When all source pairs of source and side information symbols are observable with non-zero probability, we show that this characterization gives the entire rate region. Next, we demonstrate a class of sources for which asymptotically zero feedback suffices to achieve zero-error coding at the rate promised by the Slepian-Wolf bound for asymptotically lossless coding. Finally, we illustrate these results with the aid of three simple examples.',

	{'abstract': u'Polar codes have attracted much recent attention as the first codes with low computational complexity that provably achieve optimal rate-regions for a large class of information-theoretic problems. One significant drawback, however, is that for current constructions the probability of error decays sub-exponentially in the block-length (more detailed designs improve the probability of error at the cost of significantly increased computational complexity cite). In this work we show how the the classical idea of code concatenation -- using "short" polar codes as inner codes and a "high-rate" Reed-Solomon code as the outer code -- results in substantially improved performance. In particular, code concatenation with a careful choice of parameters boosts the rate of decay of the probability of error to almost exponential in the block-length with essentially no loss in computational complexity. We demonstrate such performance improvements for three sets of information-theoretic problems -- a classical point-to-point channel coding problem, a class of multiple-input multiple output channel coding problems, and some network source coding problems.',

We then propose novel bit-flipping (BF) decoding algorithms that take into account the check node reliability. Both hard-decision (HD) and soft-decision (SD) versions are considered. The former performs better than the conventional BF algorithm and, in most cases, suffers less than 1 dB performance loss when compared with some well known SD BF decoders. For one particular code it even outperforms those SD BF decoders. The performance of the SD version is superior to that of SD BF decoders and is comparable to or even better than that of the sum-product algorithm (SPA). The latter is achieved with a complexity much less than that required by the SPA.',

This gives a smooth function on the torus. We prove that the space of all functions obtained in such a way coincides with the space that is constructed analogously when GL(n,R) is replaced with the variety of non-degenerate hermitian forms.

It is well known that beta kernel estimators are, on the contrary of classical kernel estimators, "free of boundary effect" and thus are very useful in practice. The goal of this paper is to prove that there is a price to pay: for very regular functions or for certain losses, these estimators are not minimax. Nevertheless they are minimax for classical regularities such as regularity of order two or less than two, supposed commonly in the practice and for some classical losses.',

The security of this scheme is based on the intractability of polynomial reconstruction when there is too much noise in the vector. Our approach switches from this paradigm to an Information Theoretical point of view: is there a class of elements that are so far away from the code that the list size is always superpolynomial? Or, dually speaking, is Maximum-Likelihood decoding almost surely impossible? We relate this issue to the decoding threshold of a code, and show that when the minimal distance of the code is high enough, the threshold effect is very sharp.

In particular, every free abelian group of any finite rank appears then as the kernel of a cellular cover of a cotorsion-free abelian group of rank 2. This situation is best possible in the sense that cotorsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 do not admit cellular covers with free kernel except for the trivial ones.

	{'abstract': u'We show that the boundary curves (profiles) in of the generalized projections of a body in uniquely determine a large class of shapes, and that sparse profile data, combined with projection volume (brightness) data, can be used to reconstruct the shape and the spin state of a body. We also present an optimal strategy for the relative weighting of the data modes in the inverse problem, and derive the maximum compatibility estimate (MCE) that corresponds to the maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimates in the case of a single data mode. MCE is not explicitly dependent on the noise levels, scale factors or numbers of data points of the complementary data modes, and can be determined without the mode weight parameters. We present a solution method well suitable for adaptive optics images in particular, and discuss various choices of regularization functions.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider a multi-cell MIMO downlink (network MIMO) where base-stations (BS) with antennas connected to a central station (CS) serve single-antenna user terminals (UT). Although many works have shown the potential benefits of network MIMO, the conclusion critically depends on the underlying assumptions such as channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) and backhaul links. In this paper, by focusing on the impact of partial CSIT, we propose an outage-efficient strategy. Namely, with side information of all UT's messages and local CSIT, each BS applies zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in a distributed manner. For a small number of UTs (), the ZF beamforming creates parallel MISO channels. Based on the statistical knowledge of these parallel channels, the CS performs a robust power allocation that simultaneously minimizes the outage probability of all UTs and achieves a diversity gain of per UT. With a large number of UTs (), we propose a so-called distributed diversity scheduling (DDS) scheme to select a subset of UTs with limited backhaul communication. It is proved that DDS achieves a diversity gain of , which scales optimally with the number of cooperative BSs as well as UTs. Numerical results confirm that even under realistic assumptions such as partial CSIT and limited backhaul communications, network MIMO can offer high data rates with a sufficient reliability to individual UTs.",

	{'abstract': u"We consider the multi-antenna wiretap channel in which the transmitter wishes to send a confidential message to its receiver while keeping it secret to the eavesdropper. It has been known that the secrecy capacity of such a channel does not increase with signal-to-noise ratio when the transmitter has no channel state information (CSI) under mild conditions. Motivated by Jafar's robust interference alignment technique, we study the so-called staggered multi-antenna block-fading wiretap channel where the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper have different temporal correlation structures. Assuming no CSI at transmitter, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of the channel at hand. Our results show that a positive s.d.o.f. can be ensured whenever two receivers experience different fading variation. Remarkably, very simple linear precoding schemes provide the optimal s.d.o.f. in some cases of interest.",

	{'abstract': u'We propose a two fluid theory to model a dilute polymer solution assuming that it consists of two phases, polymer and solvent, with two distinct macroscopic velocities. The solvent phase velocity is governed by the macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations with the addition of a force term describing the interaction between the two phases. The polymer phase is described on the mesoscopic level using a dumbbell model and its macroscopic velocity is obtained through averaging. We start by writing down the full phase-space distribution function for the dumbbells and then obtain the inertialess limits for the Fokker-Planck equation and for the averaged friction force acting between the phases from a rigorous asymptotic analysis. The resulting equations are relevant to the modelling of strongly non-homogeneous flows, while the standard kinetic model is recovered in the locally homogeneous case.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents some basic facts about the so-called connectivity spaces. In particular, it studies the generation of connectivity structures, the existence of limits and colimits in the main categories of connectivity spaces, the closed monoidal category structure given by the so-called tensor product on integral connectivity spaces; it defines homotopy for connectivity spaces and mention briefly related difficulties; it defines smash product of pointed integral connectivity spaces and shows that this operation results in a closed monoidal category with such spaces as objects. Then, it studies finite connectivity spaces, associating a directed acyclic graph with each such space and then defining a new numerical invariant for links: the connectivity order. Finally, it mentions the not very wellknown Brunn-Debrunner-Kanenobu theorem which asserts that every finite integral connectivity space can be represented by a link.',

	{'abstract': u"Low-complexity near-optimal detection of large-MIMO signals has attracted recent research. Recently, we proposed a local neighborhood search algorithm, namely `reactive tabu search' (RTS) algorithm, as well as a factor-graph based `belief propagation' (BP) algorithm for low-complexity large-MIMO detection. The motivation for the present work arises from the following two observations on the above two algorithms: RTS works for general M-QAM. Although RTS was shown to achieve close to optimal performance for 4-QAM in large dimensions, significant performance improvement was still possible for higher-order QAM (e.g., 16- and 64-QAM). ii) BP also was shown to achieve near-optimal performance for large dimensions, but only for alphabet. In this paper, we improve the large-MIMO detection performance of higher-order QAM signals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs RTS and BP. In particular, motivated by the observation that when a detection error occurs at the RTS output, the least significant bits (LSB) of the symbols are mostly in error, we propose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other than LSBs at the RTS output and feed the interference cancelled received signal to the BP algorithm to improve the reliability of the LSBs. The output of the BP is then fed back to RTS for the next iteration. Our simulation results show that in a 32 x 32 V-BLAST system, the proposed RTS-BP algorithm performs better than RTS by about 3.5 dB at uncoded BER and by about 2.5 dB at rate-3/4 turbo coded BER with 64-QAM at the same order of complexity as RTS. We also illustrate the performance of large-MIMO detection in frequency-selective fading channels.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix (the principal components) from a high-dimensional data matrix despite both small entry-wise noise and gross sparse errors. Recently, it has been shown that a convex program, named Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), can recover the low-rank matrix when the data matrix is corrupted by gross sparse errors. We further prove that the solution to a related convex program (a relaxed PCP) gives an estimate of the low-rank matrix that is simultaneously stable to small entrywise noise and robust to gross sparse errors. More precisely, our result shows that the proposed convex program recovers the low-rank matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted, with an error bound proportional to the noise level. We present simulation results to support our result and demonstrate that the new convex program accurately recovers the principal components (the low-rank matrix) under quite broad conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first result that shows the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), optimal for small i.i.d. noise, can be made robust to gross sparse errors; or the first that shows the newly proposed PCP can be made stable to small entry-wise perturbations.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix when some of its entries, whose locations are not known a priori, are corrupted by errors of arbitrarily large magnitude. It has recently been shown that this problem can be solved efficiently and effectively by a convex program named Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), provided that the fraction of corrupted entries and the rank of the matrix are both sufficiently small. In this paper, we extend that result to show that the same convex program, with a slightly improved weighting parameter, exactly recovers the low-rank matrix even if "almost all" of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted, provided the signs of the errors are random. We corroborate our result with simulations on randomly generated matrices and errors.',

	{'abstract': u'The recently developed short-time linear response algorithm, which predicts the average response of a nonlinear chaotic system with forcing and dissipation to small external perturbation, generally yields high precision of the response prediction, although suffers from numerical instability for long response times due to positive Lyapunov exponents. However, in the case of stochastically driven dynamics, one typically resorts to the classical fluctuation-dissipation formula, which has the drawback of explicitly requiring the probability density of the statistical state together with its derivative for computation, which might not be available with sufficient precision in the case of complex dynamics (usually a Gaussian approximation is used). Here we adapt the short-time linear response formula for stochastically driven dynamics, and observe that, for short and moderate response times before numerical instability develops, it is generally superior to the classical formula with Gaussian approximation for both the additive and multiplicative stochastic forcing. Additionally, a suitable blending with classical formula for longer response times eliminates numerical instability and provides an improved response prediction even for long response times.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider a system of particles which perform branching Brownian motion with negative drift and are killed upon reaching zero, in the near-critical regime where the total population stays roughly constant with approximately N particles. We show that the characteristic time scale for the evolution of this population is of order , in the sense that when time is measured in these units, the scaled number of particles converges to a variant of Neveu's continuous-state branching process. Furthermore, the genealogy of the particles is then governed by a coalescent process known as the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent. This validates the nonrigorous predictions by Brunet, Derrida, Muller and Munier for a closely related model.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we investigate the impact of network coding at the relay node on the stable throughput rate in multicasting cooperative wireless networks. The proposed protocol adopts Network-level cooperation in contrast to the traditional physical layer cooperative protocols and in addition uses random linear network coding at the relay node. The traffic is assumed to be bursty and the relay node forwards its packets during the periods of source silence which allows better utilization for channel resources. Our results show that cooperation will lead to higher stable throughput rates than conventional retransmission policies and that the use of random linear network coding at the relay can further increase the stable throughput with increasing Network Coding field size or number of packets over which encoding is performed.',

The lower bound is shown to be strictly larger than that for the noncausal case by Liu and Chen. Achievability is proved using block Markov coding, Shannon strategy, and key generation from common state information. The state sequence available at the end of each block is used to generate a key, which is used to enhance the transmission rate of the confidential message in the following block. An upper bound on the secrecy capacity when the state is available noncausally at the encoder and decoder is established and is shown to coincide with the lower bound for several classes of wiretap channels with state.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate quantization and feedback of channel state information in a multiuser (MU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. Each user may receive multiple data streams. Our design minimizes the sum mean squared error (SMSE) while accounting for the imperfections in channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. This paper makes three contributions: first, we provide an end-to-end SMSE transceiver design that incorporates receiver combining, feedback policy and transmit precoder design with channel uncertainty. This enables the proposed transceiver to outperform the previously derived limited feedback MU linear transceivers. Second, we remove dimensionality constraints on the MIMO system, for the scenario with multiple data streams per user, using a combination of maximum expected signal combining (MESC) and minimum MSE receiver. This makes the feedback of each user independent of the others and the resulting feedback overhead scales linearly with the number of data streams instead of the number of receiving antennas. Finally, we analyze SMSE of the proposed algorithm at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and large number of transmit antennas. As an aside, we show analytically why the bit error rate, in the high SNR regime, increases if quantization error is ignored.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses the issue of phase noise in OFDM systems. Phase noise (PHN) is a transceiver impairment resulting from the non-idealities of the local oscillator. We present a case for designing a turbo receiver for systems corrupted by phase noise by taking a closer look at the effects of the common phase error (CPE). Using an approximate probabilistic framework called variational inference (VI), we develop a soft-in soft-out (SISO) algorithm that generates posterior bit-level soft estimates while taking into account the effect of phase noise. The algorithm also provides an estimate of the phase noise sequence. Using this SISO algorithm, a turbo receiver is designed by passing soft information between the SISO detector and an outer forward error correcting (FEC) decoder that uses a soft decoding algorithm. It is shown that the turbo receiver achieves close to optimal performance.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a method to compute, quickly and efficiently, the mutual information achieved by an IID (independent identically distributed) complex Gaussian input on a block Rayleigh-faded channel without side information at the receiver. The method accommodates both scalar and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) settings. Operationally, the mutual information thus computed represents the highest spectral efficiency that can be attained using standard Gaussian codebooks. Examples are provided that illustrate the loss in spectral efficiency caused by fast fading and how that loss is amplified by the use of multiple transmit antennas. These examples are further enriched by comparisons with the channel capacity under perfect channel-state information at the receiver, and with the spectral efficiency attained by pilot-based transmission.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we establish a universal characterization of higher algebraic K-theory in the setting of small stable infinity categories. Specifically, we prove that connective algebraic K-theory is the universal additive invariant, i.e., the universal functor with values in spectra which inverts Morita equivalences, preserves filtered colimits, and satisfies Waldhausen\'s additivity theorem. Similarly, we prove that non-connective algebraic K-theory is the universal localizing invariant, i.e., the universal functor that moreover satisfies the "Thomason-Trobaugh-Neeman" localization theorem. To prove these results, we construct and study two stable infinity categories of "noncommutative motives"; one associated to additivity and another to localization. In these stable infinity categories, Waldhausen\'s S. construction corresponds to the suspension functor and connective and non-connective algebraic K-theory spectra become corepresentable by the noncommutative motive of the sphere spectrum. In particular, the algebraic K-theory of every scheme, stack, and ring spectrum can be recovered from these categories of noncommutative motives. In order to work with these categories of noncommutative motives, we establish comparison theorems between the category of spectral categories localized at the Morita equivalences and the category of small idempotent-complete stable infinity categories. We also explain in detail the comparison between the infinity categorical version of Waldhausen K-theory and the classical definition. As an application of our theory, we obtain a complete classification of the natural transformations from higher algebraic K-theory to topological Hochschild homology (THH) and topological cyclic homology (TC). Notably, we obtain an elegant conceptual description of the cyclotomic trace map.',

Specifically, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the system are derived under general arrival processes with finite first and second moments. In the case of stationary arrival processes, these conditions establish the network capacity region of the system.

	{'abstract': u'Much research has been devoted to the problem of restoring Poissonian images, namely for medical and astronomical applications. However, the restoration of these images using state-of-the-art regularizers (such as those based on multiscale representations or total variation) is still an active research area, since the associated optimization problems are quite challenging. In this paper, we propose an approach to deconvolving Poissonian images, which is based on an alternating direction optimization method. The standard regularization (or maximum a posteriori) restoration criterion, which combines the Poisson log-likelihood with a (non-smooth) convex regularizer (log-prior), leads to hard optimization problems: the log-likelihood is non-quadratic and non-separable, the regularizer is non-smooth, and there is a non-negativity constraint. Using standard convex analysis tools, we present sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of these optimization problems, for several types of regularizers: total-variation, frame-based analysis, and frame-based synthesis. We attack these problems with an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which belongs to the family of augmented Lagrangian algorithms. We study sufficient conditions for convergence and show that these are satisfied, either under total-variation or frame-based (analysis and synthesis) regularization. The resulting algorithms are shown to outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of speed and restoration accuracy.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider a three-terminal state-dependent relay channel with the channel state available non-causally at only the source. Such a model may be of interest for node cooperation in the framework of cognition, i.e., collaborative signal transmission involving cognitive and non-cognitive radios. We study the capacity of this communication model. One principal problem in this setup is caused by the relay's not knowing the channel state. In the discrete memoryless (DM) case, we establish lower bounds on channel capacity. For the Gaussian case, we derive lower and upper bounds on the channel capacity. The upper bound is strictly better than the cut-set upper bound. We show that one of the developed lower bounds comes close to the upper bound, asymptotically, for certain ranges of rates.",

This solution arises in random matrix theory and in the study of Hamiltonian perturbations of hyperbolic equations. The asymptotic behavior of y(x,t) if x to pm infty (for fixed t) is known and relatively simple, but it turns out to be more subtle when x and t tend to infinity simultaneously. We distinguish a region of algebraic asymptotic behavior and a region of elliptic asymptotic behavior, and we obtain rigorous asymptotics in both regions.

	{'abstract': u'In "Reliable Communication in the Absence of a Common Clock" (Yeung et al., 2009), the authors introduce general run-length sets, which form a class of constrained systems that permit run-lengths from a countably infinite set. For a particular definition of probabilistic capacity, they show that probabilistic capacity is equal to combinatorial capacity. In the present work, it is shown that the same result also holds for Shannon\'s original definition of probabilistic capacity. The derivation presented here is based on generating functions of constrained systems as developed in "On the Capacity of Constrained Systems" (Boecherer et al., 2010) and provides a unified information-theoretic treatment of general run-length sets.',

Here are two examples: 1) The cohomology ring of a compact three-dimensional manifold. 2) The cohomology ring of the complement of a hyperplane arrangement (the Orlik-Solomon algebra). We present some applications of the homological theory of these graded skew-commutative rings. In particular we find compact oriented 3-manifolds without boundary for which the Hilbert series of the Yoneda Ext-algebra of the cohomology ring of the fundamental group is an explicit transcendental function. This is only possible for large first Betti numbers of the 3-manifold (bigger than -- or maybe equal to -- 11). We give also examples of 3-manifolds where the Ext-algebra of the cohomology ring of the fundamental group is not finitely generated.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers a simulation-based estimator for a general class of Markovian processes and explores some strong consistency properties of the estimator. The estimation problem is defined over a continuum of invariant distributions indexed by a vector of parameters. A key step in the method of proof is to show the uniform convergence (a.s.) of a family of sample distributions over the domain of parameters. This uniform convergence holds under mild continuity and monotonicity conditions on the dynamic process. The estimator is applied to an asset pricing model with technology adoption. A challenge for this model is to generate the observed high volatility of stock markets along with the much lower volatility of other real economic aggregates.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we investigate optimal coding strategies for a class of linear deterministic relay networks. The network under study is a relay network, with one source, one destination, and two relay nodes. Additionally, there is a disturbing source of signals that causes interference with the information signals received by the relay nodes. Our model captures the effect of the interference of message signals and disturbing signals on a single relay network, or the interference of signals from multiple relay networks with each other in the linear deterministic framework. For several ranges of the network parameters we find upper bounds on the maximum achievable source--destination rate in the presense of the disturbing node and in each case we find an optimal coding scheme that achieves the upper bound.',

	{'abstract': u'Statistical inference for stochastic processes with time-varying spectral characteristics has received considerable attention in recent decades. We develop a nonparametric test for stationarity against the alternative of a smoothly time-varying spectral structure. The test is based on a comparison between the sample spectral density calculated locally on a moving window of data and a global spectral density estimator based on the whole stretch of observations. Asymptotic properties of the nonparametric estimators involved and of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of stationarity are derived. Power properties under the alternative of a time-varying spectral structure are discussed and the behavior of the test for fixed alternatives belonging to the locally stationary processes class is investigated.',

	{'abstract': u'We address some global solvability issues for classes of smooth nonsingular vector fields in the plane related to cohomological equations in geometry and dynamical systems. The first main result is that is not surjective in iff the geometrical condition -- the existence of separatrix strips -- holds. Next, for nonsurjective vector fields, we demonstrate that if the RHS has at most infra-exponential growth in the separatrix strips we can find a global weak solution near the boundaries of the separatrix strips. Finally we investigate the global solvability for perturbations with zero order p.d.o. We provide examples showing that our estimates are sharp.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the effect of imperfect feedback on the epsilon-outage capacity of incremental relaying in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We show that imperfect feedback leads to a rescaling of the pre-log factor (comparable to the multiplexing gain for networks operating in the high SNR regime) and thus reduces the epsilon-outage capacity considerably. Moreover, we investigate the effect of different degrees of feedback reliability on the system performance. We further derive a simple binary tree-based construction rule to analyze networks with an arbitrary number of relay nodes with respect to imperfect feedback. This rule can directly be mapped to a comprehensive matrix notation.',

	{'abstract': u'We derive the outage capacity of a bursty version of the amplify-and-forward (BAF) protocol for small signal-to-noise ratios when incremental relaying is used. We show that the ratio between the outage capacities of BAF and the cut-set bound is independent of the relay position and that BAF is outage optimal for certain conditions on the target rate R. This is in contrast to decode-and-forward with incremental relaying, where the relay location strongly determines the performance of the cooperative protocol. We further derive the outage capacity for a network consisting of an arbitrary number of relay nodes. In this case the relays transmit in subsequent partitions of the overall transmission block and the destination accumulates signal-to-noise ratio until it is able to decode.',

For any non-elementary discrete subgroup Gamma of G with w_0Gamma discrete, we compute an asymptotic formula for the number of points in w_0Gamma of norm at most T, provided that the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on the associated hyperbolic manifold and the Gamma skinning size of w_0 are finite. The main ergodic ingredient in our approach is the description for the limiting distribution of the orthogonal translates of a totally geodesically immersed closed submanifold of Gamma H^n. We also give a criterion on the finiteness of the Gamma skinning size of w_0 for Gamma geometrically finite.',

Upper bounds for the mean integrated squared error of the estimators are given. The upper bounds show how the difficulty of the estimation depends on the operator through the norm of the adjoint of the inverse of the operator and on the underlying function class through the entropy of the class. Corresponding lower bounds are also derived. As examples, we consider convolution operators and the Radon transform. In these examples, the estimators achieve the optimal rates of convergence.

The lines we construct are special stretch lines in the sense of Thurston. They are directed by complete geodesic laminations that are not chain-recurrent, and they have a nice description in terms of Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. At the basis of the construction are certain maps with controlled Lipschitz constants between right-angled hyperbolic hexagons having three non-consecutive edges of the same size. Using these maps, we obtain Lipschitz-minimizing maps between hyperbolic particular pairs of pants and, more generally, between some hyperbolic sufaces of finite type with arbitrary genus and arbitrary number of boundary components.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we construct low decoding complexity STBCs by using the Pauli matrices as linear dispersion matrices. In this case the Hurwitz-Radon orthogonality condition is shown to be easily checked by transferring the problem to domain. The problem of constructing low decoding complexity STBCs is shown to be equivalent to finding certain codes over . It is shown that almost all known low complexity STBCs can be obtained by this approach. New codes are given that have the least known decoding complexity in particular ranges of rate.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a dynamic primal-dual type algorithm to solve the optimal scheduling problem in wireless networks subject to uncertain parameters, which are generated by stochastic network processes such as random packet arrivals, channel fading, and node mobilities. The algorithm is a generalization of the well-known max-weight scheduling algorithm proposed by Tassiulas et al., where only queue length information is used for computing the schedules when the arrival rates are uncertain. Using the technique of fluid limits, sample path convergence of the algorithm to an arbitrarily close to optimal solution is proved, under the assumption that the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) applies to the random processes which generate the uncertain parameters. The performance of the algorithm is further verified by simulation results. The method may potentially be applied to other applications where dynamic algorithms for convex problems with uncertain parameters are needed.',

	{'abstract': u'In cognitive radio, spectrum sensing is a key component to detect spectrum holes (i.e., channels not used by any primary users). Collaborative spectrum sensing among the cognitive radio nodes is expected to improve the ability of checking complete spectrum usage states. Unfortunately, due to power limitation and channel fading, available channel sensing information is far from being sufficient to tell the unoccupied channels directly. Aiming at breaking this bottleneck, we apply recent matrix completion techniques to greatly reduce the sensing information needed. We formulate the collaborative sensing problem as a matrix completion subproblem and a joint-sparsity reconstruction subproblem. Results of numerical simulations that validated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are presented. In particular, in noiseless cases, when number of primary user is small, exact detection was obtained with no more than 8% of the complete sensing information, whilst as number of primary user increases, to achieve a detection rate of 95.55%, the required information percentage was merely 16.8%.',

The core of the paper is the proof of the existence of an asymptotic expansion of the relative heat trace for small times. We find the decay of the conformal factor at infinity for which this asymptotic expansion exists and the relative determinant is defined. Following the paper by B. Osgood, R. Phillips and P.

	{'abstract': u'We consider one-dimensional substitution tiling spaces where the dilatation (stretching factor) is a degree d Pisot number, and where the first rational Cech cohomology is d-dimensional. We construct examples of such "homological Pisot" substitutions that do not have pure discrete spectra. These examples are not unimodular, and we conjecture that the coincidence rank must always divide a power of the norm of the dilatation. To support this conjecture, we show that homological Pisot substitutions exhibit an Exact Regularity Property (ERP), in which the number of occurrences of a patch for a return length is governed strictly by the length. The ERP puts strong constraints on the measure of any cylinder set in the corresponding tiling space.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a hypercyclicity property of linear dynamical systems: a bounded linear operator T acting on a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space X is said to be hypercyclic if there exists a vector x in X such that x : n&gt;0 is dense in X, and frequently hypercyclic if there exists x in X such that for any non empty open subset U of X, the set has positive lower density. We prove that if T is a bounded operator on X which has "sufficiently many" eigenvectors associated to eigenvalues of modulus 1 in the sense that these eigenvectors are perfectly spanning, then T is automatically frequently hypercyclic.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper addresses an interference channel consisting of active users sharing frequency sub-bands. Users are asynchronous meaning there exists a mutual delay between their transmitted codes. A stationary model for interference is considered by assuming the starting point of an interferer's data is uniformly distributed along the codeword of any user. This model is not ergodic, however, we show that the noise plus interference process satisfies an Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) under certain conditions. This enables us to define achievable rates in the conventional Shannon sense. The spectrum is divided to private and common bands. Each user occupies its assigned private band and the common band upon activation. In a scenario where all transmitters are unaware of the number of active users and the channel gains, the optimum spectrum assignment is obtained such that the so-called outage capacity per user is maximized. If , all users follow a locally Randomized On-Off signaling scheme on the common band where each transmitter quits transmitting its Gaussian signals independently from transmission to transmission. Achievable rates are developed using a conditional version of Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) and an upper bound on the differential entropy of a mixed Gaussian random variable. Thereafter, the activation probability on each transmission slot together with the spectrum assignment are designed resulting in the largest outage capacity.",

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we study 2-representations of 2-quantum groups (in the sense of Rouquier and Khovanov-Lauda) categorifying tensor products of irreducible representations. Our aim is to construct knot homologies categorifying Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of knots for arbitrary representations, which will be done in a follow-up paper. We consider an algebraic construction of these categories, via an explicit diagrammatic presentation, generalizing the cyclotomic quotient of the quiver Hecke algebra. One of our primary results is that these categories coincide when both are defined. We also investigate finer structure of these categories. Like many similar representation-theoretic categories, they are standardly stratified and satisfy a double centralizer property with respect to their self-dual modules. The standard modules of the stratification play an important role, as Vermas do in more classical representation theory, as test objects for functors. The existence of these representations has consequences for the structure of previously studied categorifications; it allows us to prove the non-degeneracy of Khovanov and Lauda's 2-category (that its Hom spaces have the expected dimension) in all symmetrizable types, and that the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras are symmetric Frobenius.",

We show that for such a nonlinear system having nonisolated equilibria, if the system asymptotically converges to a constant time-delay system and this new system is semistable, then the original time-varying delay system is semistable. In proving our results, we extend the limiting differential equation approach to time-varying delay systems and also develop some new convergence results for functional differential equations.',

Let be an abelian variety of dimension defined over a field of odd characteristic. Our algorithm decomposes in two principal steps. First, given a theta null point for and a subgroup isotropic for the Weil pairing, we explain how to compute the theta null point corresponding to the quotient abelian variety . Then, from the knowledge of a theta null point of , we give an algorithm to obtain a rational expression for an isogeny from to . The algorithm resulting as the combination of these two steps can be viewed as a higher dimensional analog of the well known algorithm of V 'elu to compute isogenies between elliptic curves. In the case that is isomorphic to for , the overall time complexity of this algorithm is equivalent to additions in and a constant number of root extractions in the base field of . In order to improve the efficiency of our algorithms, we introduce a compressed representation that allows to encode a point of level of a dimensional abelian variety using only coordinates. We also give formulas to compute the Weil and commutator pairings given input points in theta coordinates.",

	{'abstract': u'By studying the representation theory of a certain infinite -group and using the generalised characters of Hopkins, Kuhn and Ravenel we find useful ways of understanding the rational Morava -theory of the classifying spaces of general linear groups over finite fields. Making use of the well understood theory of formal group laws we establish more subtle results integrally, building on relevant work of Tanabe. In particular, we study in detail the cases where the group has dimension less than or equal to the prime at which the -theory is localised.',

	{'abstract': u'Current medium access control mechanisms are based on collision avoidance and collided packets are discarded. The recent work on ZigZag decoding departs from this approach by recovering the original packets from multiple collisions. In this paper, we present an algebraic representation of collisions which allows us to view each collision as a linear combination of the original packets. The transmitted, colliding packets may themselves be a coded version of the original packets. We propose a new acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism for collisions based on the idea that if a set of packets collide, the receiver can afford to ACK exactly one of them and still decode all the packets eventually. We analytically compare delay and throughput performance of such collision recovery schemes with other collision avoidance approaches in the context of a single hop wireless erasure network. In the multiple receiver case, the broadcast constraint calls for combining collision recovery methods with network coding across packets at the sender. From the delay perspective, our scheme, without any coordination, outperforms not only a ALOHA-type random access mechanisms, but also centralized scheduling. For the case of streaming arrivals, we propose a priority-based ACK mechanism and show that its stability region coincides with the cut-set bound of the packet erasure network.',

	{'abstract': u'We prove global subelliptic estimates for systems of quadratic differential operators. Quadratic differential operators are operators defined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued quadratic symbols. In a previous work, we pointed out the existence of a particular linear subvector space in the phase space intrinsically associated to their Weyl symbols, called singular space, which rules a number of fairly general properties of non-elliptic quadratic operators. About the subelliptic properties of these operators, we established that quadratic operators with zero singular spaces fulfill global subelliptic estimates with a loss of derivatives depending on certain algebraic properties of the Hamilton maps associated to their Weyl symbols. The purpose of the present work is to prove similar global subelliptic estimates for overdetermined systems of quadratic operators. We establish here a simple criterion for the subellipticity of these systems giving an explicit measure of the loss of derivatives and highlighting the non-trivial interactions played by the different operators composing those systems.',

The extensive experiments indicate that the method furnishes the exact solution in more then 99.7 percent of the cases. The average number of steps is 5.67 (we have not found any examples which required more than 13 steps) and the relative number of steps with respect to the dimension decreases dramatically. Roughly speaking, for high enough dimensions the absolute number of steps is independent of the dimension.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the estimation problem in a regression-type model. To be able to deal with potential high dimensions, we provide a procedure called LOL, for Learning Out of Leaders with no optimization step. LOL is an auto-driven algorithm with two thresholding steps. A first adaptive thresholding helps to select leaders among the initial regressors in order to obtain a first reduction of dimensionality. Then a second thresholding is performed on the linear regression upon the leaders. The consistency of the procedure is investigated. Exponential bounds are obtained, leading to minimax and adaptive results for a wide class of sparse parameters, with (quasi) no restriction on the number p of possible regressors. An extensive computational experiment is conducted to emphasize the practical good performances of LOL.',

	{'abstract': u'Iterative decoding was not originally introduced as the solution to an optimization problem rendering the analysis of its convergence very difficult. In this paper, we investigate the link between iterative decoding and classical optimization techniques. We first show that iterative decoding can be rephrased as two embedded minimization processes involving the Fermi-Dirac distance. Based on this new formulation, an hybrid proximal point algorithm is first derived with the additional advantage of decreasing a desired criterion. In a second part, an hybrid minimum entropy algorithm is proposed with improved performance compared to the classical iterative decoding. Even if this paper focus on iterative decoding for BICM, the results can be applied to the large class of turbo-like decoders.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the ergodicity and consensus problem for a discrete-time linear dynamic model driven by random stochastic matrices, which is equivalent to studying these concepts for the product of such matrices. Our focus is on the model where the random matrices have independent but time-variant distribution. We introduce a new phenomenon, the infinite flow, and we study its fundamental properties and relations with the ergodicity and consensus. The central result is the infinite flow theorem establishing the equivalence between the infinite flow and the ergodicity for a class of independent random models, where the matrices in the model have a common steady state in expectation and a feedback property. For such models, this result demonstrates that the expected infinite flow is both necessary and sufficient for the ergodicity. The result is providing a deterministic characterization of the ergodicity, which can be used for studying the consensus and average consensus over random graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we derive valid Edgeworth expansions for studentized versions of a large class of statistics when the data are generated by a strongly mixing process. Under dependence, the asymptotic variance of such a statistic is given by an infinite series of lag-covariances, and therefore, studentizing factors (i.e., estimators of the asymptotic standard error) typically involve an increasing number, say, of lag-covariance estimators, which are themselves quadratic functions of the observations. The unboundedness of the dimension of these quadratic functions makes the derivation and the form of the expansions nonstandard. It is shown that in contrast to the case of the studentized means under independence, the derived Edgeworth expansion is a superposition of three distinct series, respectively, given by one in powers of , one in powers of (resulting from the standard error of the studentizing factor) and one in powers of the bias of the studentizing factor, where denotes the sample size.',

	{'abstract': u'Aiming at monitoring a time series to detect stationarity as soon as possible, we introduce monitoring procedures based on kernel-weighted sequential Dickey-Fuller (DF) processes, and related stopping times, which may be called weighted Dickey-Fuller control charts. Under rather weak assumptions, (functional) central limit theorems are established under the unit root null hypothesis and local-to-unity alternatives. For gen- eral dependent and heterogeneous innovation sequences the limit processes depend on a nuisance parameter. In this case of practical interest, one can use estimated control limits obtained from the estimated asymptotic law. Another easy-to-use approach is to transform the DF processes to obtain limit laws which are invariant with respect to the nuisance pa- rameter. We provide asymptotic theory for both approaches and compare their statistical behavior in finite samples by simulation.',

	{'abstract': u'When analysing time series an important issue is to decide whether the time series is stationary or a random walk. Relaxing these notions, we consider the problem to decide in favor of the I(0)- or I(1)-property. Fixed-sample statistical tests for that problem are well studied in the literature. In this paper we provide first results for the problem to monitor sequentially a time series. Our stopping times are based on a sequential version of a kernel-weighted variance-ratio statistic. The asymptotic distributions are established for I(1) processes, a rich class of stationary processes, possibly affected by local nonpara- metric alternatives, and the local-to-unity model. Further, we consider the two interesting change-point models where the time series changes its behaviour after a certain fraction of the observations and derive the associated limiting laws. Our Monte-Carlo studies show that the proposed detection procedures have high power when interpreted as a hypothesis test, and that the decision can often be made very early.',

	{'abstract': u'In many applications one is interested to detect certain (known) patterns in the mean of a process with smallest delay. Using an asymptotic framework which allows to capture that feature, we study a class of appropriate sequential nonparametric kernel procedures under local nonparametric alternatives. We prove a new theorem on the con- vergence of the normed delay of the associated sequential detection procedure which holds for dependent time series under a weak mixing condition. The result suggests a simple procedure to select a kernel from a finite set of candidate kernels, and therefore may also be of interest from a practical point of view. Further, we provide two new theorems about the existence and an explicit representation of optimal kernels minimizing the asymptotic normed delay. The results are illustrated by some examples.',

A well studied and natural nonparametric estimator for the distribution function in this model is the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). We study two alternative methods for the estimation of the distribution function, assuming some smoothness of the event time distribution. The first estimator is based on a maximum smoothed likelihood approach. The second method is based on smoothing the (discrete) MLE of the distribution function.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper sequential monitoring schemes to detect nonparametric drifts are studied for the random walk case. The procedure is based on a kernel smoother. As a by-product we obtain the asymptotics of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator and its as- sociated sequential partial sum process under non-standard sampling. The asymptotic behavior differs substantially from the stationary situation, if there is a unit root (random walk component). To obtain meaningful asymptotic results we consider local nonpara- metric alternatives for the drift component. It turns out that the rate of convergence at which the drift vanishes determines whether the asymptotic properties of the monitoring procedure are determined by a deterministic or random function. Further, we provide a theoretical result about the optimal kernel for a given alternative.',

	{'abstract': u'Convolutional LDPC ensembles, introduced by Felstrom and Zigangirov, have excellent thresholds and these thresholds are rapidly increasing as a function of the average degree. Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed to date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of convolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism which explains why "convolutional-like" or "spatially coupled" codes perform so well. In essence, the spatial coupling of the individual code structure has the effect of increasing the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble to its maximum possible value, namely the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. For this reason we call this phenomenon "threshold saturation." This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One significant advantage of such a construction is that one can create capacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius which is increasing in the blocklength. Our proof makes use of the area theorem of the BP-EXIT curve and the connection between the MAP and BP threshold recently pointed out by Measson, Montanari, Richardson, and Urbanke. Although we prove the connection between the MAP and the BP threshold only for a very specific ensemble and only for the binary erasure channel, empirically a threshold saturation phenomenon occurs for a wide class of ensembles and channels. More generally, we conjecture that for a large range of graphical systems a similar saturation of the "dynamical" threshold occurs once individual components are coupled sufficiently strongly. This might give rise to improved algorithms as well as to new techniques for analysis.',

The posterior density is derived based on the limited information likelihood. The posterior distribution converges to zero exponentially fast on any -contraction outside the identified region. Inside, it is bounded below by a positive constant if the identified region is assumed to have a nonempty interior. Our simulation evidence indicates that the Bayesian approach has advantages over frequentist methods, in the sense that, with a proper choice of the prior, the posterior provides more information about the true parameter inside the identified region. We also address the problem of moment and model selection. Our optimality criterion is the maximum posterior procedure and we show that, asymptotically, it selects the true moment/model combination with the most moment inequalities and the simplest model.',

	{'abstract': u'Fountain codes are rateless erasure-correcting codes, i.e., an essentially infinite stream of encoded packets can be generated from a finite set of data packets. Several fountain codes have been proposed recently to minimize overhead, many of which involve modifications of the Luby transform (LT) code. These fountain codes, like the LT code, have the implicit assumption that the probability distribution is fixed throughout the encoding process. In this paper, we will use the theory of posets to show that this assumption is unnecessary, and by dropping it, we can achieve overhead reduction by as much as 64% lower than LT codes. We also present the fundamental theory of probability distribution designs for fountain codes with non-constant probability distributions that minimize overhead.',

	{'abstract': u'We prove the following results concerning the list decoding of error-correcting codes: (i) We show that for textit code with a relative distance of (over a large enough alphabet), the following result holds for textit: With high probability, for a fraction of random errors (for any ), the received word will have only the transmitted codeword in a Hamming ball of radius around it. Thus, for random errors, one can correct twice the number of errors uniquely correctable from worst-case errors for any code. A variant of our result also gives a simple algorithm to decode Reed-Solomon codes from random errors that, to the best of our knowledge, runs faster than known algorithms for certain ranges of parameters. (ii) We show that concatenated codes can achieve the list decoding capacity for erasures. A similar result for worst-case errors was proven by Guruswami and Rudra (SODA 08), although their result does not directly imply our result. Our results show that a subset of the random ensemble of codes considered by Guruswami and Rudra also achieve the list decoding capacity for erasures.

	{'abstract': u'Total variation (TV) regularization is popular in image restoration and reconstruction due to its ability to preserve image edges. To date, most research activities on TV models concentrate on image restoration from blurry and noisy observations, while discussions on image reconstruction from random projections are relatively fewer. In this paper, we propose, analyze, and test a fast alternating minimization algorithm for image reconstruction from random projections via solving a TV regularized least-squares problem. The per-iteration cost of the proposed algorithm involves a linear time shrinkage operation, two matrix-vector multiplications and two fast Fourier transforms. Convergence, certain finite convergence and -linear convergence results are established, which indicate that the asymptotic convergence speed of the proposed algorithm depends on the spectral radii of certain submatrix. Moreover, to speed up convergence and enhance robustness, we suggest an accelerated scheme based on an inexact alternating direction method. We present experimental results to compare with an existing algorithm, which indicate that the proposed algorithm is stable, efficient and competitive with TwIST cite -- a state-of-the art algorithm for solving TV regularization problems.',

	{'abstract': u'A new achievability rate region for the secure discrete memoryless Multiple-Access-Channel (MAC) is presented. Thereafter, a novel secure coding scheme is proposed to achieve a positive Secure Degrees-of-Freedom (S-DoF) in the single-antenna MAC. This scheme converts the single-antenna system into a multiple-dimension system with fractional dimensions. The achievability scheme is based on the alignment of signals into a small sub-space at the eavesdropper, and the simultaneous separation of the signals at the intended receiver. Tools from the field of Diophantine Approximation in number theory are used to analyze the probability of error in the coding scheme.',

	{'abstract': u'An interactive function computation problem in a collocated network is studied in a distributed block source coding framework. With the goal of computing a desired function at the sink, the source nodes exchange messages through a sequence of error-free broadcasts. The infinite-message minimum sum-rate is viewed as a functional of the joint source pmf and is characterized as the least element in a partially ordered family of functionals having certain convex-geometric properties. This characterization leads to a family of lower bounds for the infinite-message minimum sum-rate and a simple optimality test for any achievable infinite-message sum-rate. An iterative algorithm for evaluating the infinite-message minimum sum-rate functional is proposed and is demonstrated through an example of computing the minimum function of three sources.',

For even values of the power p, we show that blowup (or failure to scatter) must be accompanied by blowup of the critical Sobolev norm.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study a substantial generalization of the model of excited random walk introduced in [Electron. Commun. Probab. 8 (2003) 86-92] by Benjamini and Wilson. We consider a discrete-time stochastic process taking values on , , described as follows: when the particle visits a site for the first time, it has a uniformly-positive drift in a given direction ; when the particle is at a site which was already visited before, it has zero drift. Assuming uniform ellipticity and that the jumps of the process are uniformly bounded, we prove that the process is ballistic in the direction so that . A key ingredient in the proof of this result is an estimate on the probability that the process visits less than distinct sites by time n, where is some positive number depending on the parameters of the model. This approach completely avoids the use of tan points and coupling methods specific to the excited random walk. Furthermore, we apply this technique to prove that the excited random walk in an i.i.d. random environment satisfies a ballistic law of large numbers and a central limit theorem.',

	{'abstract': u'The "Divide and Concur\'\' (DC) algorithm, recently introduced by Gravel and Elser, can be considered a competitor to the belief propagation (BP) algorithm, in that both algorithms can be applied to a wide variety of constraint satisfaction, optimization, and probabilistic inference problems. We show that DC can be interpreted as a message-passing algorithm on a constraint graph, which helps make the comparison with BP more clear. The "difference-map\'\' dynamics of the DC algorithm enables it to avoid "traps\'\' which may be related to the "trapping sets\'\' or "pseudo-codewords\'\' that plague BP decoders of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes in the error-floor regime. We investigate two decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes based on these ideas. The first decoder is based directly on DC, while the second decoder borrows the important "difference-map\'\' concept from the DC algorithm and translates it into a BP-like decoder. We show that this "difference-map belief propagation\'\' (DMBP) decoder has dramatically improved error-floor performance compared to standard BP decoders, while maintaining a similar computational complexity. We present simulation results for LDPC codes on the additive white Gaussian noise and binary symmetric channels, comparing DC and DMBP decoders with other decoders based on BP, linear programming, and mixed-integer linear programming.',

The class includes as special cases fully parametric models; semi-parametric models, like the multiindex and the partially linear models; and models with shape constraints. Another feature of the test is that it allows both the response variable and the covariate be multivariate, which means that multiple regression curves can be tested simultaneously. The test also allows the presence of infinite-dimensional nuisance functions in the model to be tested. It is shown that the empirical likelihood test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed under certain mild conditions and permits a wild bootstrap calibration. Despite the large size of the class of models to be considered, the empirical likelihood test enjoys good power properties against departures from a hypothesized model within the class.',

We propose a channel model for the non-coherent network coding introduced by Koetter and Kschischang in [6], that captures the essence of such a network operation, and calculate the capacity as a function of network parameters. We prove that use of subspace coding is optimal, and show that, in some cases, the capacity-achieving distribution uses subspaces of several dimensions, where the employed dimensions depend on the packet length. This model and the results also allow us to give guidelines on when subspace coding is beneficial for the proposed model and by how much, in comparison to a coding vector approach, from a capacity viewpoint. We extend our results to the case of multiple source multicast that creates a virtual multiple access channel.',

	{'abstract': u'In the first part of the paper, we present a short survey of the theory of multipliers, or double centralisers, of Banach algebras and completely contractive Banach algebras. Our approach is very algebraic: this is a deliberate attempt to separate essentially algebraic arguments from topological arguments. We concentrate upon the problem of how to extend module actions, and homomorphisms, from algebras to multiplier algebras. We then consider the special cases when we have a bounded approximate identity, and when our algebra is self-induced. In the second part of the paper, we mainly concentrate upon dual Banach algebras. We provide a simple criterion for when a multiplier algebra is a dual Banach algebra. This is applied to show that the multiplier algebra of the convolution algebra of a locally compact quantum group is always a dual Banach algebra. We also study this problem within the framework of abstract Pontryagin duality, and show that we construct the same weak-topology. We explore the notion of a Hopf convolution algebra, and show that in many cases, the use of the extended Haagerup tensor product can be replaced by a multiplier algebra.',

	{'abstract': u'The Ising model is widely regarded as the most studied model of spin-systems in statistical physics. The focus of this paper is its dynamic (stochastic) version, the Glauber dynamics, introduced in 1963 and by now the most popular means of sampling the Ising measure. Intensive study throughout the last three decades has yielded a rigorous understanding of the spectral-gap of the dynamics on everywhere except at criticality. While the critical behavior of the Ising model has long been the focus for physicists, mathematicians have only recently developed an understanding of its critical geometry with the advent of SLE, CLE and new tools to study conformally invariant systems. A rich interplay exists between the static and dynamic models. At the static phase-transition for Ising, the dynamics is conjectured to undergo a critical slowdown: At high temperature the inverse-gap is O(1), at the critical it is polynomial in the side-length and at low temperature it is exponential in it. A seminal series of papers verified this on except at where the behavior remained a challenging open problem. Here we establish the first rigorous polynomial upper bound for the critical mixing, thus confirming the critical slowdown for the Ising model in . Namely, we show that on a finite box with arbitrary (e.g. fixed, free, periodic) boundary conditions, the inverse-gap at is polynomial in the side-length. The proof harnesses recent understanding of the scaling limit of critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the Ising model together with classical tools from the analysis of Markov chains.',

In particular, the spectra of small geodesic spheres in a harmonic space determine whether the space is locally symmetric. For the proof we use the first few heat invariants and consider certain coefficients in the radial power series expansions of the curvature invariants and of the geodesic spheres.

	{'abstract': u'An important estimation problem that is closely related to large-scale multiple testing is that of estimating the null density and the proportion of nonnull effects. A few estimators have been introduced in the literature; however, several important problems, including the evaluation of the minimax rate of convergence and the construction of rate-optimal estimators, remain open. In this paper, we consider optimal estimation of the null density and the proportion of nonnull effects. Both minimax lower and upper bounds are derived. The lower bound is established by a two-point testing argument, where at the core is the novel construction of two least favorable marginal densities and . The density is heavy tailed both in the spatial and frequency domains and is a perturbation of such that the characteristic functions associated with and match each other in low frequencies. The minimax upper bound is obtained by constructing estimators which rely on the empirical characteristic function and Fourier analysis. The estimator is shown to be minimax rate optimal. Compared to existing methods in the literature, the proposed procedure not only provides more precise estimates of the null density and the proportion of the nonnull effects, but also yields more accurate results when used inside some multiple testing procedures which aim at controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The procedure is easy to implement and numerical results are given.',

	{'abstract': u"Orthogonality is a much desired property for MIMO coding. It enables symbol-wise decoding, where the errors in other symbol estimates do not affect the result, thus providing an optimality that is worth pursuing. Another beneficial property is a low complexity soft decision decoder, which for orthogonal complex MIMO codes is known for two transmit (Tx) antennas i.e. for the Alamouti code. We propose novel soft decision decoders for the orthogonal complex MIMO codes on three and four Tx antennas and extend the old result of maximal ratio combining (MRC) to cover all orthogonal codes up to four Tx antennas. As a rule, a sophisticated transmission scheme encompasses forward error correction (FEC) coding, and its performance is measured at the FEC decoder instead of at the MIMO decoder. We introduce the receiver structure that delivers the MIMO decoder's soft decisions to the demodulator, which in turn cranks out the logarithm of likelihood ratio (LLR) of each bit and delivers them to the FEC decoder. This makes a significant improvement on the receiver, where a maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO decoder makes hard decisions at a too early stage. Further, the additional gain is achieved with stunningly low complexity.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider maps on orientable surfaces. A map is called emph if it has a single face. A emph is a map (of genus ) with a marked unicellular spanning submap (which can have any genus in ). Our main result is a bijection between covered maps with edges and genus and pairs made of a plane tree with edges and a unicellular bipartite map of genus with edges. In the planar case, covered maps are maps with a marked spanning tree and our bijection specializes into a construction obtained by the first author in cite. Covered maps can also be seen as emph of two unicellular maps (one representing the unicellular submap, the other representing the dual unicellular submap). Thus, our bijection gives a correspondence between shuffles of unicellular maps, and pairs made of a plane tree and a unicellular bipartite map. In terms of counting, this establishes the equivalence between a formula due to Harer and Zagier for general unicellular maps, and a formula due to Jackson for bipartite unicellular maps. We also show that the bijection of Bouttier, Di Francesco and Guitter cite (which generalizes a previous bijection by Schaeffer cite) between bipartite maps and so-called well-labelled mobiles can be obtained as a special case of our bijection.',

As a particular case, the solutions of the corresponding PT-Hydrogen atom that includes a complex term are obtained, and it is found that a non-Hermitian Runge-Lenz vector is a conserved quantity. In this way, we obtain a set of non-Hermitian operators that satisfy the SO(4)-Lie algebra.',

	{'abstract': u'We identify a subalgebra pH_n of the extended affine Hecke algebra eH_n of type A. The subalgebra pH_n is a u-analogue of the monoid algebra of S_n ltimes ZZ_^n and inherits a canonical basis from that of eH_n. We show that its left cells are naturally labeled by tableaux filled with positive integer entries having distinct residues mod n, which we term emph (PAT). We then exhibit a cellular subquotient R_ of pH_n that is a u-analogue of the ring of coinvariants CC[y_1,...,y_n]/(e_1,...,e_n) with left cells labeled by PAT that are essentially standard Young tableaux with cocharge labels. Multiplying canonical basis elements by a certain element pi in pH_n corresponds to rotations of words, and on cells corresponds to cocyclage. We further show that R_ has cellular quotients R_ lambda that are u-analogues of the Garsia-Procesi modules R_ lambda with left cells labeled by (a PAT version of) the lambda-catabolizable tableaux. We give a conjectural description of a cellular filtration of pH_n, the subquotients of which are isomorphic to dual versions of R_ lambda under the perfect pairing on R_. We conjecture how this filtration relates to the combinatorics of the cells of eH_n worked out by Shi, Lusztig, and Xi. We also conjecture that the k-atoms of Lascoux, Lapointe, and Morse and the R-catabolizable tableaux of Shimozono and Weyman have cellular counterparts in pH_n. We extend the idea of atom copies of Lascoux, Lapoint, and Morse to positive affine tableaux and give descriptions, mostly conjectural, of some of these copies in terms of catabolizability.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers a parallel system of queues fed by independent arrival streams, where the service rate of each queue depends on the number of customers in all of the queues. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the system are derived, based on stochastic monotonicity and marginal drift properties of multiclass birth and death processes. These conditions yield a sharp characterization of stability for systems, where the service rate of each queue is decreasing in the number of customers in other queues, and has uniform limits as the queue lengths tend to infinity. The results are illustrated with applications where the stability region may be nonconvex.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper we elaborate a general homotopy-theoretic framework in which to study problems of descent and completion and of their duals, codescent and cocompletion. Our approach to homotopic (co)descent and to derived (co)completion can be viewed as -category-theoretic, as our framework is constructed in the universe of simplicially enriched categories, which are a model for -categories. We provide general criteria, reminiscent of Mandell's theorem on -algebra models of -complete spaces, under which homotopic (co)descent is satisfied. Furthermore, we construct general descent and codescent spectral sequences, which we interpret in terms of derived (co)completion and homotopic (co)descent. We show that a number of very well-known spectral sequences, such as the unstable and stable Adams spectral sequences, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence and the descent spectral sequence of a map, are examples of general (co)descent spectral sequences. There is also a close relationship between the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture and homotopic descent along the Dwyer-Friedlander map from algebraic K-theory to 'etale K-theory. Moreover, there are intriguing analogies between derived cocompletion (respectively, completion) and homotopy left (respectively, right) Kan extensions and their associated assembly (respectively, coassembly) maps.",

In both cases three integrals of motions are constructed and equations of motion are solved exactly in the special cylindrical coordinates on the base of the method of separation of variables. In Lobachevsky space there exist trajectories of two types, finite and infinite in radial variable, in Riemann space all motions are finite and periodical. The invariance of the uniform magnetic field in tensor description and gauge invariance of corresponding 4-potential description is demonstrated explicitly. The role of the symmetry is clarified in classification of all possible solutions, based on the geometric symmetry group, SO(3,1) and SO(4) respectively.',

	{'abstract': u'In the quantum mechanical Hilbert space formalism, the probabilistic interpretation is a later ad-hoc add-on, more or less enforced by the experimental evidence, but not motivated by the mathematical model itself. A model involving a clear probabilistic interpretation from the very beginning is provided by the quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. It includes the projection lattices in von Neumann algebras and here probability conditionalization becomes identical with the state transition of the Lueders - von Neumann measurement process. This motivates the definition of a hierarchy of five compatibility and comeasurability levels in the abstract setting of the quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. Their meanings are: the absence of quantum interference or influence, the existence of a joint distribution, simultaneous measurability, and the independence of the final state after two successive measurements from the sequential order of these two measurements. A further level means that two elements of the quantum logic (events) belong to the same Boolean subalgebra. In the general case, the five compatibility and comeasurability levels appear to differ, but they all coincide in the common Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, in von Neumann algebras, and in some other cases.',

	{'abstract': u'For a tuple of complex number, buliding on the approximation techniques in earlier papers of this series, this paper engages in deducing lower estimates on the transcendence degree of the field generated by over the field of rational numbers from the approximability of the point in projective space by hypersurfaces. The first given result is an new proof of an algebraic independence criterion, that was formerly proved by Laurent and Roy, and generalizes the Philippon criterion by introducing also evaluations of derivatives of global sections. The second result is a new kind of algebraic independence criteria that has a wider range of applicabilty than the first one.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the droplet that results from conditioning the subcritical Fortuin-Kasteleyn planar random cluster model on the presence of an open circuit Gamma_0 encircling the origin and enclosing an area of at least (or exactly) n^2. In this paper, we prove that the resulting circuit is highly regular: we define a notion of a regeneration site in such a way that, for any such element v of Gamma_0, the circuit Gamma_0 cuts through the radial line segment through v only at v. We show that, provided that the conditioned circuit is centred at the origin in a natural sense, the set of regeneration sites reaches into all parts of the circuit, with maximal distance from one such site to the next being at most logarithmic in n with high probability. The result provides a flexible control on the conditioned circuit that permits the use of surgical techniques to bound its fluctuations, and, as such, it plays a crucial role in the derivation of bounds on the local fluctuation of the circuit carried out in arXiv:1001.1527 and arXiv:1001.1528.',

	{'abstract': u"This is the first in a series of three papers that addresses the behaviour of the droplet that results, in the percolating phase, from conditioning the Fortuin-Kasteleyn planar random cluster model on the presence of an open dual circuit Gamma_0 encircling the origin and enclosing an area of at least (or exactly) n^2. (By the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation, the model is a close relative of the droplet formed by conditioning the Potts model on an excess of spins of a given type.) We consider local deviation of the droplet boundary, measured in a radial sense by the maximum local roughness, MLR(Gamma_0), this being the maximum distance from a point in the circuit Gamma_0 to the boundary of the circuit's convex hull; and in a longitudinal sense by what we term maximum facet length, MFL(Gamma_0), namely, the length of the longest line segment of which the boundary of the convex hull is formed. The principal conclusion of the series of papers is the following uniform control on local deviation: that there are positive constants c and C such that the conditional probability that the normalised quantity n^ big( log n big)^ MLR(Gamma_0) lies in the interval [c,C] tends to 1 in the high n-limit; and that the same statement holds for n^ big( log n big)^ MFL(Gamma_0). In this way, we confirm the anticipated n^ scaling of maximum local roughness, and provide a sharp logarithmic power-law correction. This local deviation behaviour occurs by means of locally Gaussian effects constrained globally by curvature, and we believe that it arises in a range of radially defined stochastic interface models, including several in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This paper is devoted to proving the upper bounds in these assertions, and includes a heuristic overview of the surgical technique used in the three papers.",

	{'abstract': u'The framework of a new scale invariant analysis on a Cantor set , presented originally in , is clarified and extended further. For an arbitrarily small , elements in satisfying together with an inversion rule are called relative infinitesimals relative to the scale . A non-archimedean absolute value is assigned to each such infinitesimal which is then shown to induce a non-archimedean structure in the full Cantor set . A valued measure constructed using the new absolute value is shown to give rise to the finite Hausdorff measure of the set. The definition of differentiability on in the non-archimedean sense is introduced. The associated Cantor function is shown to relate to the valuation on which is then reinterpreated as a locally constant function in the extended non-archimedean space. The definitions and the constructions are verified explicitly on a Cantor set which is defined recursively from deleting number of open intervals each of length leaving out numbers of closed intervals so that',

	{'abstract': u'The formulation of a new analysis on a zero measure Cantor set is presented. A non-archimedean absolute value is introduced in exploiting the concept of infinitesimals and a scale invariant ultrametric valuation of the form for a given scale and infinitesimals . Using this new absolute value, a valued (metric) measure is defined on and is shown to be equal to the finite Hausdorff measure of the set, if it exists. The formulation of a scale invariant real analysis is also outlined, when the singleton of the real line is replaced by a zero measure Cantor set. The Cantor function is realised as a locally constant function in this setting. The ordinary derivative in is replaced by the scale invariant logarithmic derivative on the set of valued infinitesimals. As a result, the ordinary real valued functions are expected to enjoy some novel asymptotic properties, which might have important applications in number theory and in other areas of mathematics.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the performance of antenna array processing in distributed multiple access networks without power control. The interference is represented as a Poisson point process. Desired and interfering signals are subject to both path-loss fading (with an exponent greater than 2) and to independent Rayleigh fading. Using these assumptions, we derive the exact closed form expression for the cumulative distribution function of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio when optimum combining is applied. This results in a pertinent measure of the network performance in terms of the outage probability, which in turn provides insights into the network capacity gain that could be achieved with antenna array processing. We present and discuss examples of applications, as well as some numerical results.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, the ergodic sum-rate and outage probability of a downlink single-antenna channel with K users are analyzed in the presence of Rayleigh flat fading, where limited channel state information (CSI) feedback is assumed. Specifically, only 1-bit feedback per fading block per user is available at the base station. We first study the ergodic sum-rate of the 1-bit feedback scheme, and consider the impact of feedback delay on the system. A closed-form expression for the achievable ergodic sum-rate is presented as a function of the fading temporal correlation coefficient. It is proved that the sum-rate scales as loglogK, which is the same scaling law achieved by the optimal non-delayed full CSI feedback scheme. The sum-rate degradation due to outdated CSI is also evaluated in the asymptotic regimes of either large K or low SNR. The outage performance of the 1-bit feedback scheme for both instantaneous and outdated feedback is then investigated. Expressions for the outage probabilities are derived, along with the corresponding diversity-multiplexing tradeoffs (DMT). It is shown that with instantaneous feedback, a power allocation based on the feedback bits enables to double the DMT compared to the case with short-term power constraint in which a dynamic power allocation is not allowed. But, with outdated feedback, the advantage of power allocation is lost, and the DMT reverts to that achievable with no CSI feedback. Nevertheless, for finite SNR, improvement in terms of outage probability can still be obtained.',

	{'abstract': u'In previous work, the first author established a natural bijection between minimal subshifts and maximal regular J-classes of free profinite semigroups. In this paper, the Sch "utzenberger groups of such J-classes are investigated, in particular in respect to a conjecture proposed by the first author concerning their profinite presentation. The conjecture is established for all non-periodic minimal subshifts associated with substitutions. It entails that it is decidable whether a finite group is a quotient of such a profinite group. As a further application, the Sch "utzenberger group of the J-class corresponding to the Prouhet-Thue-Morse subshift is shown to admit a somewhat simpler presentation, from which it follows that it has rank three, and that it is non-free relatively to any pseudovariety of groups.',

	{'abstract': u'The inner automorphisms of a group G can be characterized within the category of groups without reference to group elements: they are precisely those automorphisms of G that can be extended, in a functorial manner, to all groups H given with homomorphisms G --&gt; H. Unlike the group of inner automorphisms of G itself, the group of such extended systems of automorphisms is always isomorphic to G. A similar characterization holds for inner automorphisms of an associative algebra R over a field K; here the group of functorial systems of automorphisms is isomorphic to the group of units of R modulo units of K. If one substitutes "endomorphism" for "automorphism" in these considerations, then in the group case, the only additional example is the trivial endomorphism; but in the K-algebra case, a construction unfamiliar to ring theorists, but known to functional analysts, also arises. Systems of endomorphisms with the same functoriality property are examined in some other categories; other uses of the phrase "inner endomorphism" in the literature, some overlapping the one introduced here, are noted; the concept of an inner of an associative or Lie algebra is looked at from the same point of view, and the dual concept of a "co-inner" endomorphism is briefly examined.

	{'abstract': u'We consider a cooperative wireless network in the presence of one of more eavesdroppers, and exploit node cooperation for achieving physical (PHY) layer based security. Two different cooperation schemes are considered. In the first scheme, cooperating nodes retransmit a weighted version of the source signal in a decode-and-forward (DF) fashion. In the second scheme, while the source is transmitting, cooperating nodes transmit weighted noise to confound the eavesdropper (cooperative jamming (CJ)). We investigate two objectives, i.e., maximization of achievable secrecy rate subject to a total power constraint, and minimization of total power transmit power under a secrecy rate constraint. For the first design objective with a single eavesdropper we obtain expressions for optimal weights under the DF protocol in closed form, and give an algorithm that converges to the optimal solution for the CJ scheme; while for multiple eavesdroppers we give an algorithm for the solution using the DF protocol that is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution for two eavesdroppers. For the second design objective, existing works introduced additional constraints in order to reduce the degree of difficulty, thus resulting in suboptimal solutions. In this work, either a closed form solution is obtained, or algorithms to search for the solution are proposed. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed schemes and demonstrate the advantages of cooperation as compared to direct transmission.',

	{'abstract': u'In this article we develop convergence theory for a general class of adaptive approximation algorithms for abstract nonlinear operator equations on Banach spaces, and use the theory to obtain convergence results for practical adaptive finite element methods (AFEM) applied to several classes of nonlinear elliptic equations. In the first part of the paper, we develop a weak-* convergence framework for nonlinear operators, whose Gateaux derivatives are locally Lipschitz and satisfy a local inf-sup condition. The framework can be viewed as extending the recent convergence results for linear problems of Morin, Siebert and Veeser to a general nonlinear setting. We formulate an abstract adaptive approximation algorithm for nonlinear operator equations in Banach spaces with local structure. The weak-* convergence framework is then applied to this class of abstract locally adaptive algorithms, giving a general convergence result. The convergence result is then applied to a standard AFEM algorithm in the case of several semilinear and quasi-linear scalar elliptic equations and elliptic systems, including: a semilinear problem with subcritical nonlinearity, the steady Navier-Stokes equations, and a quasilinear problem with nonlinear diffusion. This yields several new AFEM convergence results for these nonlinear problems. In the second part of the paper we develop a second abstract convergence framework based on strong contraction, extending the recent contraction results for linear problems of Cascon, Kreuzer, Nochetto, and Siebert and of Mekchay and Nochetto to abstract nonlinear problems. The contraction result is then applied to a standard AFEM algorithm for semilinear problems with sub- and super-critical nonlinearities and for the Hamiltonian constraint in general relativity.',

We generalize via Schur functors the constructions of the lower central series to any symmetric tensor category; specifically we compute the modified first quotient bar_1, and second and third quotients B_2, and B_3 of the series for a free algebra T(V) in any symmetric tensor category, generalizing the main results of (arXiv:math/0610410) and (arXiv:0902.4899). In the case A_:=T( CC^), we use these results to compute the explicit Hilbert series.

	{'abstract': u'Various methods have been used to obtain improvements of the Goppa lower bound for the minimum distance of an algebraic geometric code. The main methods divide into two categories and all but a few of the known bounds are special cases of either the Lundell-McCullough floor bound or the Beelen order bound. The exceptions are recent improvements of the floor bound by Guneri-Stichtenoth-Taskin, and Duursma-Park, and of the order bound by Duursma-Park and Duursma-Kirov. In this paper we provide short proofs for all floor bounds and most order bounds in the setting of the van Lint and Wilson AB method. Moreover, we formulate unifying theorems for order bounds and formulate the DP and DK order bounds as natural but different generalizations of the Feng-Rao bound for one-point codes.',

	{'abstract': u'Network coding theory studies the transmission of information in networks whose vertices may perform nontrivial encoding and decoding operations on data as it passes through the network. The main approach to deciding the feasibility of network coding problems aims to reduce the problem to optimization over a polytope of entropic vectors subject to constraints imposed by the network structure. In the case of directed acyclic graphs, these constraints are completely understood, but for general graphs the problem of enumerating them remains open: it is not known how to classify the constraints implied by a property that we call serializability, which refers to the absence of paradoxical circular dependencies in a network code. In this work we initiate the first systematic study of the constraints imposed on a network code by serializability. We find that serializability cannot be detected solely by evaluating the Shannon entropy of edge sets in the graph, but nevertheless, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that decides the serializability of a network code. We define a certificate of non-serializability, called an information vortex, that plays a role in the theory of serializability comparable to the role of fractional cuts in multicommodity flow theory, including a type of min-max relation. Finally, we study the serializability deficit of a network code, defined as the minimum number of extra bits that must be sent in order to make it serializable. For linear codes, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this parameter within a constant factor, and we demonstrate some surprising facts about the behavior of this parameter under parallel composition of codes.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose a nonlinear elasticity model of macromolecular conformational change (deformation) induced by electrostatic forces generated by an implicit solvation model. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the electrostatic potential is analyzed in a domain varying with the elastic deformation of molecules, and a new continuous model of the electrostatic forces is developed to ensure solvability of the nonlinear elasticity equations. We derive the estimates of electrostatic forces corresponding to four types of perturbations to an electrostatic potential field, and establish the existance of an equilibrium configuration using a fixed-point argument, under the assumption that the change in the ionic strength and charges due to the additional molecules causing the deformation are sufficiently small. The results are valid for elastic models with arbitrarily complex dielectric interfaces and cavities, and can be generalized to large elastic deformation caused by high ionic strength, large charges, and strong external fields by using continuation methods.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we examine a number of additive and multiplicative multilevel iterative methods and preconditioners in the setting of two-dimensional local mesh refinement. While standard multilevel methods are effective for uniform refinement-based discretizations of elliptic equations, they tend to be less effective for algebraic systems which arise from discretizations on locally refined meshes, losing their optimal behavior in both storage and computational complexity. Our primary focus here is on BPX-style additive and multiplicative multilevel preconditioners, and on various stabilizations of the additive and multiplicative hierarchical basis method (HB), and their use in the local mesh refinement setting. In this article, we describe in detail the implementation of these types of algorithms, including detailed discussions of the datastructures and traversal algorithms we employ for obtaining optimal storage and computational complexity in our implementations. We show how each of the algorithms can be implemented using standard datatypes available in languages such as C and FORTRAN, so that the resulting algorithms have optimal (linear) storage requirements, and so that the resulting multilevel method or preconditioner can be applied with optimal (linear) computational costs. Our implementations are performed in both C and MATLAB using the Finite Element ToolKit (FETK), an open source finite element software package. We finish the paper with a sequence of numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of a number of BPX and stabilized HB variants for several examples requiring local refinement.',

	{'abstract': u'In this article, we establish optimality of the Bramble-Pasciak-Xu (BPX) norm equivalence and optimality of the wavelet modified (or stabilized) hierarchical basis (WHB) preconditioner in the setting of local 3D mesh refinement. In the analysis of WHB methods, a critical first step is to establish the optimality of BPX norm equivalence for the refinement procedures under consideration. While the available optimality results for the BPX norm have been constructed primarily in the setting of uniformly refined meshes, a notable exception is the local 2D red-green result due to Dahmen and Kunoth. The purpose of this article is to extend this original 2D optimality result to the local 3D red-green refinement procedure introduced by Bornemann-Erdmann-Kornhuber (BEK), and then to use this result to extend the WHB optimality results from the quasiuniform setting to local 2D and 3D red-green refinement scenarios. The BPX extension is reduced to establishing that locally enriched finite element subspaces allow for the construction of a scaled basis which is formally Riesz stable. It is possible to show that the number of degrees of freedom used for smoothing is bounded by a constant times the number of degrees of freedom introduced at that level of refinement, indicating that a practical implementable version of the resulting BPX preconditioner for the BEK refinement setting has provably optimal (linear) computational complexity per iteration. An interesting implication of the optimality of the WHB preconditioner is the a priori H1-stability of the L2-projection. The theoretical framework employed supports arbitrary spatial dimension d &gt;= 1 and requires no coefficient smoothness assumptions beyond those required for well-posedness in H1.',

	{'abstract': u'Adaptive multilevel finite element methods are developed and analyzed for certain elliptic systems arising in geometric analysis and general relativity. This class of nonlinear elliptic systems of tensor equations on manifolds is first reviewed, and then adaptive multilevel finite element methods for approximating solutions to this class of problems are considered in some detail. Two a posteriori error indicators are derived, based on local residuals and on global linearized adjoint or dual problems. The design of Manifold Code (MC) is then discussed; MC is an adaptive multilevel finite element software package for 2- and 3-manifolds. It employs a posteriori error estimation, adaptive simplex subdivision, unstructured algebraic multilevel methods, global inexact Newton methods, and numerical continuation methods for the numerical solution of nonlinear covariant elliptic systems on 2- and 3-manifolds. Some of the more interesting features of MC are described in detail, including some new ideas for topology and geometry representation in simplex meshes, and an unusual partition of unity-based method for exploiting parallel computers. A short example is then given which involves the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints in the Einstein equations, a representative nonlinear 4-component covariant elliptic system on a Riemannian 3-manifold which arises in general relativity. A number of operator properties and solvability results recently established are first summarized, making possible two quasi-optimal a priori error estimates for Galerkin approximations which are then derived. These two results complete the theoretical framework for effective use of adaptive multilevel finite element methods. A sample calculation using the MC software is then presented.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a class of adaptive multilevel domain decomposition-like algorithms, built from a combination of adaptive multilevel finite element, domain decomposition, and partition of unity methods. These algorithms have several interesting features such as very low communication requirements, and they inherit a simple and elegant approximation theory framework from partition of unity methods. They are also very easy to use with highly complex sequential adaptive finite element packages, requiring little or no modification of the underlying sequential finite element software. The parallel algorithm can be implemented as a simple loop which starts off a sequential local adaptive solve on a collection of processors simultaneously. We first review the Partition of Unity Method (PUM) of Babuvska and Melenk, and outline the PUM approximation theory framework. We then describe a variant we refer to here as the Parallel Partition of Unity Method (PPUM), which is a combination of the Partition of Unity Method with the parallel adaptive algorithm of Bank and Holst. We then derive two global error estimates for PPUM, by exploiting the PUM analysis framework it inherits, and by employing some recent local estimates of Xu and Zhou. We then discuss a duality-based variant of PPUM which is more appropriate for certain applications, and we derive a suitable variant of the PPUM approximation theory framework. Our implementation of PPUM-type algorithms using the FETK and MC software packages is described. We then present a short numerical example involving the Einstein constraints arising in gravitational wave models.',

It is illustrated why symmetrizing may be a bad idea for linear methods. It is conjectured that enforcing minimal symmetry achieves the best results when combined with conjugate gradient acceleration. Also, it is shown that absence of symmetry in the linear preconditioner is advantageous when the linear method is accelerated by using the Bi-CGstab method.

We then apply this result to show that the long-time behavior of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, in both two- and three-dimensions, is determined by the long-time behavior of a finite set of bounded linear functionals. These functionals are constructed by local surface averages of solutions over certain simplex volume elements, and are therefore well-defined for weak solutions. Moreover, these functionals define a projection operator which satisfies the necessary approximation inequality for our theory. We use the general theory to establish lower bounds on the simplex diameters in both two- and three-dimensions. Furthermore, in the three dimensional case we make a connection between their diameters and the Kolmogoroff dissipation small scale in turbulent flows.',

The main difficulty for mixed finite element methods is the lack of minimization principle and thus the failure of orthogonality. A quasi-orthogonality property is proved using the fact that the error is orthogonal to the divergence free subspace, while the part of the error that is not divergence free can be bounded by the data oscillation using a discrete stability result. This discrete stability result is also used to get a localized discrete upper bound which is crucial for the proof of the optimality of the adaptive approximation.',

	{'abstract': u'A widely used electrostatics model in the biomolecular modeling community, the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, along with its finite element approximation, are analyzed in this paper. A regularized Poisson-Boltzmann equation is introduced as an auxiliary problem, making it possible to study the original nonlinear equation with delta distribution sources. A priori error estimates for the finite element approximation are obtained for the regularized Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on certain quasi-uniform grids in two and three dimensions. Adaptive finite element approximation through local refinement driven by an a posteriori error estimate is shown to converge. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation does not appear to have been previously studied in detail theoretically, and it is hoped that this paper will help provide molecular modelers with a better foundation for their analytical and computational work with the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Note that this article apparently gives the first rigorous convergence result for a numerical discretization technique for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation with delta distribution sources, and it also introduces the first provably convergent adaptive method for the equation. This last result is currently one of only a handful of existing convergence results of this type for nonlinear problems.',

	{'abstract': u'We obtain non asymptotic bounds for the Monte Carlo algorithm associated to the Euler discretization of some diffusion processes. The key tool is the Gaussian concentration satisfied by the density of the discretization scheme. This Gaussian concentration is derived from a Gaussian upper bound of the density of the scheme and a modification of the so-called "Herbst argument" used to prove Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. We eventually establish a Gaussian lower bound for the density of the scheme that emphasizes the concentration is sharp.',

	{'abstract': u"Under an appropriate regular variation condition, the affinely normalized partial sums of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables converges weakly to a non-Gaussian stable random variable. A functional version of this is known to be true as well, the limit process being a stable L 'vy process. The main result in the paper is that for a stationary, regularly varying sequence for which clusters of high-threshold excesses can be broken down into asymptotically independent blocks, the properly centered partial sum process still converges to a stable L 'vy process. Due to clustering, the L 'vy triple of the limit process can be different from the one in the independent case. The convergence takes place in the space of c `dl `g functions endowed with Skorohod's topology, the more usual topology being inappropriate as the partial sum processes may exhibit rapid successions of jumps within temporal clusters of large values, collapsing in the limit to a single jump. The result rests on a new limit theorem for point processes which is of independent interest. The theory is applied to moving average processes, squared GARCH(1,1) processes and stochastic volatility models.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose a novel transmit signal structure and an adjusted and optimized receiver for OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing). Instead of the conventional cyclic prefix we use a deterministic sequence, which we call unique word (UW), as guard interval. We show how unique words, which are already well investigated for single carrier systems with frequency domain equalization (SC/FDE), can also be introduced in OFDM symbols. Since unique words represent known sequences, they can advantageously be used for synchronization and channel estimation purposes. Furthermore, the proposed approach introduces a complex number Reed-Solomon (RS-) code structure within the sequence of subcarriers. This allows for RS-decoding or to apply a highly efficient Wiener smoother succeeding a zero forcing stage at the receiver. We present simulation results in an indoor multipath environment to highlight the advantageous properties of the proposed scheme.',

In order to know how the relevant operators act in representation spaces of osp(1|2), we study all unitary, irreducible star representations of this Lie superalgebra.

	{'abstract': u"The electromagnetic fields in Maxwell's theory satisfy linear equations in the classical vacuum. This is modified in classical non-linear electrodynamic theories. To date there has been little experimental evidence that any of these modified theories are tenable. However with the advent of high-intensity lasers and powerful laboratory magnetic fields this situation may be changing. We argue that an approach involving the self-consistent relativistic motion of a smooth fluid-like distribution of matter (composed of a large number of charged or neutral particles) in an electromagnetic field offers a viable theoretical framework in which to explore the experimental consequences of non-linear electrodynamics. We construct such a model based on the theory of Born and Infeld and suggest that a simple laboratory experiment involving the propagation of light in a static magnetic field could be used to place bounds on the fundamental coupling in that theory. Such a framework has many applications including a new description of the motion of particles in modern accelerators and plasmas as well as phenomena in astrophysical contexts such as in the environment of magnetars, quasars and gamma-ray bursts.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider DNA codes based on the nearest-neighbor (stem) similarity model which adequately reflects the "hybridization potential" of two DNA sequences. Our aim is to present a survey of bounds on the rate of DNA codes with respect to a thermodynamically motivated similarity measure called an additive stem similarity. These results yield a method to analyze and compare known samples of the nearest neighbor "thermodynamic weights" associated to stacked pairs that occurred in DNA secondary structures.',

	{'abstract': u"The problem of the fluctuation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two i.i.d. sequences of length has been open for decades. There exist contradicting conjectures on the topic. Chvatal and Sankoff conjectured in 1975 that asymptotically the order should be , while Waterman conjectured in 1994 that asymptotically the order should be . A contiguous substring consisting only of one type of symbol is called a block. In the present work, we determine the order of the fluctuation of the LCS for a special model of sequences consisting of i.i.d. blocks whose lengths are uniformly distributed on the set , with a given positive integer. We showed that the fluctuation in this model is asymptotically of order , which confirm Waterman's conjecture. For achieving this goal, we developed a new method which allows us to reformulate the problem of the order of the variance as a (relatively) low dimensional optimization problem.",

We prove the so called complex bounds for sufficiently renormalizable pairs with bounded combinatorics. This allows us to show that if the critical exponent a is close to an even number then the renormalization operator has a unique fixed point. Furthermore this fixed point is hyperbolic and its codimension one stable manifold contains all infinitely renormalizable pairs.',

	{'abstract': u'Let X be an infinite compact metric space, alpha : X to X a minimal homeomorphism, u the unitary implementing alpha in the transformation group C*-algebra, and S a class of separable nuclear C*-algebras that contains all unital hereditary C*-subalgebras of C*-algebras in S. Motivated by the success of tracial approximation by finite dimensional C*-algebras as an abstract characterization of classifiable C*-algebras and the idea that classification results for C*-algebras tensored with UHF algebras can be used to derive classification results up to tensoring with the Jiang-Su algebra Z, we prove that the transformation group C*-algebra tensored with a UHF algebra is tracially approximately S if there exists a y in X such that a certain C*-subalgebra is tracially approximately S. If the class S consists of finite dimensional C*-algebras, this can be used to deduce classification up to tensoring with Z for C*-algebras associated to minimal dynamical systems where projections separate tracial states. This is done without making any assumptions on the real rank or stable rank of either the transformation group C*-algebra or the C*-subalgebra, nor on the dimension of X. The result is a key step in the classification of C*-algebras associated to uniquely ergodic minimal dynamical systems by their ordered K-groups. It also sets the stage to provide further classification results for those C*-algebras of minimal dynamical systems where projections do not necessarily separate traces.',

We show that the limiting mean eigenvalue distribution of this model can be characterized as the first component of a pair of measures (mu_1,mu_2) that solve a constrained vector equilibrium problem. The proof is based on the steepest descent analysis of the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem for multiple orthogonal polynomials. We illustrate our results in detail for the case of a quartic double well potential V(x) = x^4/4 - tx^2/2.

An immediate consequence is a well-known result of Roquette on the Schur indices of the simple components of group algebras of finite nilpotent groups. As an application, we obtain that the unit group of the integral group ring of a finite nilpotent group has a subgroup of finite index that is generated by three nilpotent groups for which we have an explicit description of their generators. Another application is a new construction of free subgroups in the unit group. In all the constructions dealt with, pairs of subgroups , called strong Shoda pairs, and explicit constructed central elements play a crucial role.

	{'abstract': u'We show that the Laplace approximation of a supremum by Lp-norms has interesting consequences in optimization. For instance, the logarithmic barrier functions (LBF) of a primal convex problem P and its dual appear naturally when using this simple approximation technique for the value function g of P or its Legendre-Fenchel conjugate. In addition, minimizing the LBF of the dual is just evaluating the Cramer transform of the Laplace approximation of g. Finally, this technique permits to sometimes define an explicit dual problem in cases when the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of g cannot be derived explicitly from its definition.',

	{'abstract': u'User scheduling and multiuser multi-antenna (MU-MIMO) transmission are at the core of high rate data-oriented downlink schemes of the next-generation of cellular systems (e.g., LTE-Advanced). Scheduling selects groups of users according to their channels vector directions and SINR levels. However, when scheduling is applied independently in each cell, the inter-cell interference (ICI) power at each user receiver is not known in advance since it changes at each new scheduling slot depending on the scheduling decisions of all interfering base stations. In order to cope with this uncertainty, we consider the joint operation of scheduling, MU-MIMO beamforming and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). We develop a game-theoretic framework for this problem and build on stochastic optimization techniques in order to find optimal scheduling and ARQ schemes. Particularizing our framework to the case of "outage service rates", we obtain a scheme based on adaptive variable-rate coding at the physical layer, combined with ARQ at the Logical Link Control (ARQ-LLC). Then, we present a novel scheme based on incremental redundancy Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) that is able to achieve a throughput performance arbitrarily close to the "genie-aided service rates", with no need for a genie that provides non-causally the ICI power levels. The novel HARQ scheme is both easier to implement and superior in performance with respect to the conventional combination of adaptive variable-rate coding and ARQ-LLC.',

	{'abstract': u'For the last almost three decades, since the famous Buchberger-M "oller(BM) algorithm emerged, there has been wide interest in vanishing ideals of points and associated interpolation polynomials. Our paradigm is based on the theory of bivariate polynomial interpolation on cartesian point sets that gives us related degree reducing interpolation monomial and Newton bases directly. Since the bases are involved in the computation process as well as contained in the final output of BM algorithm, our paradigm obviously simplifies the computation and accelerates the BM process. The experiments show that the paradigm is best suited for the computation over finite prime fields that have many applications.',

This is much stronger than the corresponding finite form, stating that in any finite coloring of the integers there are arbitrarily long finite sets with the same property. We extend the finite form of Hindman\'s Theorem to a "transfinite" version for each countable ordinal, and show that Hindman\'s Theorem is equivalent to the appropriate transfinite approximation holding for every countable ordinal.

	{'abstract': u'A good understanding of conformal field theory (CFT) at c=0 is vital to the physics of disordered systems, as well as geometrical problems such as polymers and percolation. Steady progress has shown that these CFTs should be logarithmic, with indecomposable operator product expansions, and indecomposable representations of the Virasoro algebra. In one of the earliest papers on the subject, V. Gurarie introduced a single parameter b to quantify this indecomposability in terms of the logarithmic partner t of the stress energy tensor T. He and A. Ludwig conjectured further that b=-5/8 for polymers and b=5/6 for percolation. While a lot of physics may be hidden behind this parameter - which has also given rise to a lot of discussions - it had remained very elusive up to now, due to the lack of available methods to measure it experimentally or numerically, in contrast say with the central charge. We show in this paper how to overcome the many difficulties in trying to measure b. This requires control of a lattice scalar product, lattice Jordan cells, together with a precise construction of the state L_|0&gt;. The final result is that b=5/6 for polymers. For percolation, we find that b=-5/8 within an XXZ or supersymmetric representation. In the geometrical representation, we do not find a Jordan cell for L_0 at level two (finite-size Hamiltonian and transfer matrices are fully diagonalizable), so there is no b in this case.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the downlink of a cellular network with multiple cells and multi-antenna base stations including arbitrary inter-cell cooperation, realistic distance-dependent pathloss and general "fairness" requirements. Beyond Monte Carlo simulation, no efficient computation method to evaluate the ergodic throughput of such systems has been provided so far. We propose an analytic method based on the combination of the large random matrix theory with Lagrangian optimization. The proposed method is computationally much more efficient than Monte Carlo simulation and provides a very accurate approximation (almost indistinguishable) for the actual finite-dimensional case, even for of a small number of users and base station antennas. Numerical examples include linear 2-cell and planar three-sectored 7-cell layouts, with no inter-cell cooperation, sector cooperation, and full cooperation.',

We show that has diverse behavior and exhibit most of the complexities that are possible for a bicanonical map of surfaces of general type, depending on the type of X. There are cases in which is an embedding, and if so happens, embeds as a projectively normal variety, and cases in which is not an embedding. If the latter, is finite of degree 1, 2 or 4. We also study the canonical ring of X, proving that it is generated in degree less than or equal to 3 and finding the number of generators in each degree. For generators of degree 2 we find a nice general formula which holds for canonical covers of arbitrary degrees. We show that this formula depends only on the geometric and the arithmetic genus of X.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present an algorithm for computing a matrix representation for a surface in P^3 parametrized over a 2-dimensional toric variety T. This algorithm follows the ideas of [Botbol-Dickenstein-Dohm-09] and it was implemented in Macaulay2. We showed in [BDD09] that such a surface can be represented by a matrix of linear syzygies if the base points are finite in number and form locally a complete intersection, and in [Botbol-09] we generalized this to the case where the base locus is not necessarily a local complete intersection. The key point consists in exploiting the sparse structure of the parametrization, which allows us to obtain significantly smaller matrices than in the homogeneous case.',

Matrix extension plays an important role in many areas such as electronic engineering, system sciences, applied mathematics, and pure mathematics. As an application of our general results on matrix extension with symmetry, we obtain a satisfactory algorithm for constructing symmetric paraunitary filter banks and symmetric orthonormal multiwavelets by deriving high-pass filters with symmetry from any given low-pass filters with symmetry.

	{'abstract': u'Let I_g,* denote the (pointed) Torelli group. This is the group of homotopy classes of homeomorphisms of the genus g &gt;= 2 surface S_g with a marked point, acting trivially on H := H_1(S_g). In 1983 Johnson constructed a beautiful family of invariants tau_i: H_i(I_g,*) -&gt; / ^ H for 0 &lt;= i &lt;= 2g-2, using a kind of Abel-Jacobi map for families, in order to detect nontrivial cycles in I_g,*. Johnson proved that tau_1 is an isomorphism rationally, and asked if the same is true for tau_i with i &gt; 1. The goal of this paper is to introduce various methods for computing tau_i; in particular we prove that tau_i is not injective (even rationally) for any 2 &lt;= i &lt; g, and that tau_2 is surjective. For g &gt;= 3, we find enough classes in the image of tau_i to deduce that H_i(I_g,*, Q) is nonzero for each 1 &lt;= i &lt; g, in contrast with mapping class groups. Many of our classes are stable, so we can deduce that H_i(I_infty,1, Q) is infinite-dimensional for each i &gt;= 1. Finally, we conjecture a new kind of "representation-theoretic stability" for the homology of the Torelli group, for which our results provide evidence.',

This is a generalization of Forney's GMD decoding, which was considered only for L = 1, i.e. outer Bounded Minimum Distance decoding. One important example for (L+1)/L-extended Bounded Distance decoders is decoding of L-Interleaved Reed-Solomon codes. Our main contribution is a threshold location formula, which allows to optimally erase unreliable inner decoding results, for a given number of decoding trials and parameter L. Thereby, the term optimal means that the residual codeword error probability of the concatenated code is minimized. We give an estimation of this probability for any number of decoding trials.",

In the first, D is the image of a corank one stable germ of a map from complex n-space to complex (n+1)-space, and is not free. In the second, D is the discriminant of a versal deformation of a weighted homogeneous function with isolated critical point (subject to certain numerical conditions on the weights). Here D itself is already free. We also prove an elementary result, inspired by these first two, from which we obtain a plethora of new examples of free divisors.

Cowling showed that if is 1-quasiconformal on an open subset of a Carnot group G, then composition with preserves Q-harmonic functions, where Q denotes the homogeneous dimension of G. Then they combine this with a regularity theorem for Q-harmonic functions to show that is in fact . As an application, they observe that a Liouville type theorem holds for some Carnot groups of step 2. In this article we argue, using the Engel group as an example, that a Liouville type theorem can be proved for every Carnot group. Indeed, the fact that 1-quasiconformal maps are smooth allows us to obtain a Liouville type theorem by applying the Tanaka prolongation theory.',

	{'abstract': u'This thesis was inspired by work of M. Cowling, F. De Mari, A. Koranyi and M. Reimann, who studied multicontact structures for the homogeneous manifolds G/P, where G is a semisimple Lie group and P is the minimal parabolic subgroup of G. The multicontact structure here arises naturally by the nilpotent component N of the Iwasawa decomposition of G, which is an open and dense subset of G/P. In the thesis two problems are addressed. The first one concerns the representation of simple Lie algebras in terms of polynomial algebras. More precisely, a polynomial basis for split simple Lie algebras is explicitly given in a suitable choice of coordinates. The second problem investigates the multicontact structure on Hessenberg manifolds. These manifolds can be locally viewed as quotient of the nilpotent component in the Iwasawa decomposition of semisimple Lie groups. Then the multicontact structure is inherited by the one in the Iwasawa nilpotent case. Rigidity with respect to this structure is studied and proved for a large subclass of Hessenberg manifolds.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the problem of dealing with incomplete or imprecise acquisition of data in computer vision and computer graphics, we extend results concerning the stability of persistent homology with respect to function perturbations to results concerning the stability with respect to domain perturbations. Domain perturbations can be measured in a number of different ways. An important method to compare domains is the Hausdorff distance. We show that by encoding sets using the distance function, the multidimensional matching distance between rank invariants of persistent homology groups is always upperly bounded by the Hausdorff distance between sets. Moreover we prove that our construction maintains information about the original set. Other well known methods to compare sets are considered, such as the symmetric difference distance between classical sets and the sup-distance between fuzzy sets. Also in these cases we present results stating that the multidimensional matching distance between rank invariants of persistent homology groups is upperly bounded by these distances. An experiment showing the potential of our approach concludes the paper.',

	{'abstract': u'Complex computer codes, for instance simulating physical phenomena, are often too time expensive to be directly used to perform uncertainty, sensitivity, optimization and robustness analyses. A widely accepted method to circumvent this problem consists in replacing cpu time expensive computer models by cpu inexpensive mathematical functions, called metamodels. In this paper, we focus on the Gaussian process metamodel and two essential steps of its definition phase. First, the initial design of the computer code input variables (which allows to fit the metamodel) has to honor adequate space filling properties. We adopt a numerical approach to compare the performance of different types of space filling designs, in the class of the optimal Latin hypercube samples, in terms of the predictivity of the subsequent fitted metamodel. We conclude that such samples with minimal wrap-around discrepancy are particularly well-suited for the Gaussian process metamodel fitting. Second, the metamodel validation process consists in evaluating the metamodel predictivity with respect to the initial computer code. We propose and test an algorithm which optimizes the distance between the validation points and the metamodel learning points in order to estimate the true metamodel predictivity with a minimum number of validation points. Comparisons with classical validation algorithms and application to a nuclear safety computer code show the relevance of this new sequential validation design.',

If f is a strong partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on a closed 3-manifold M and if is nilpotent, then the lifts of the stable and unstable foliations are quasi-isometric in the universal of M.

	{'abstract': u'We study the model of Directed Polymers in Random Environment in 1+1 dimensions, where the distribution at a site has a tail which decays regularly polynomially with power alpha, where alpha in (0,2). After proper scaling of temperature beta^, we show strong localization of the polymer to a favorable region in the environment where energy and entropy are best balanced. We prove that this region has a weak limit under linear scaling and identify the limiting distribution as an ( alpha, beta)-indexed family of measures on Lipschitz curves lying inside the 45-degrees-rotated square with unit diagonal. In particular, this shows order n transversal fluctuations of the polymer. If, and only if, alpha is small enough, we find that there exists a random critical temperature below which, but not above, the effect of the environment is macroscopic. The results carry over to d+1 dimensions for d&gt;1 with minor modifications.',

	{'abstract': u'Convolutional network-error correcting codes (CNECCs) are known to provide error correcting capability in acyclic instantaneous networks within the network coding paradigm under small field size conditions. In this work, we investigate the performance of CNECCs under the error model of the network where the edges are assumed to be statistically independent binary symmetric channels, each with the same probability of error (). We obtain bounds on the performance of such CNECCs based on a modified generating function (the transfer function) of the CNECCs. For a given network, we derive a mathematical condition on how small should be so that only single edge network-errors need to be accounted for, thus reducing the complexity of evaluating the probability of error of any CNECC. Simulations indicate that convolutional codes are required to possess different properties to achieve good performance in low and high regimes. For the low regime, convolutional codes with good distance properties show good performance. For the high regime, convolutional codes that have a good textit (the minimum normalized cycle weight) are seen to be good. We derive a lower bound on the slope of any rate convolutional code with a certain degree.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider noncoherent random linear coding networks (RLCNs) as a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) whose input and output alphabets consist of subspaces. This contrasts with previous channel models in the literature which assume matrices as the channel input and output. No particular assumptions are made on the network topology or the transfer matrix, except that the latter may be rank-deficient according to some rank deficiency probability distribution. We introduce a random vector basis selection procedure which renders the DMC symmetric. The capacity we derive can be seen as a lower bound on the capacity of noncoherent RLCNs, where subspace coding suffices to achieve this bound.',

	{'abstract': u'In his book "Mathematical Mind-Benders", Peter Winkler poses the following open problem, originally due to the first author: "[In the game Peer Pressure,] two players are dealt some number of cards, initially face up, each card carrying a different integer. In each round, the players simultaneously play a card; the higher card is discarded and the lower card passed to the other player. The player who runs out of cards loses. As the number of cards dealt becomes larger, what is the limiting probability that one of the players will have a winning strategy?" We show that the answer to this question is zero, as Winkler suspected. Moreover, assume the cards are dealt so that one player receives r &gt;= 1 cards for every one card of the other. Then if r &lt; phi = (1+sqrt 5)/2, the limiting probability that either player has a winning strategy is still zero, while if r &gt; phi, it is one.',

	{'abstract': u'The construction of an infinite tensor product of the C*-algebra C_0(R) is not obvious, because it is nonunital, and it has no nonzero projection. Based on a choice of an approximate identity, we construct here an infinite tensor product of C_0(R), denoted L_V. We use this to construct (partial) group algebras for the full continuous unitary representation theory of the group R^(N) = the infinite sequences with real entries, of which only finitely many entries are nonzero. We obtain an interpretation of the Bochner-Minlos theorem in R^(N) as the pure state space decomposition of the partial group algebras which generate L_V. We analyze the representation theory of L_V, and show that there is a bijection between a natural set of representations of L_V and the continuous unitary representations of R^(N), but that there is an extra part which essentially consists of the representation theory of a multiplicative semigroup which depends on the initial choice of approximate identity.',

	{'abstract': u'The classical matter fields are sections of a vector bundle E with base manifold M. The space L^2(E) of square integrable matter fields w.r.t. a locally Lebesgue measure on M, has an important module action of C_b^ infty(M) on it. This module action defines restriction maps and encodes the local structure of the classical fields. For the quantum context, we show that this module action defines an automorphism group on the algebra A, of the canonical anticommutation relations on L^2(E), with which we can perform the analogous localization. That is, the net structure of the CAR, A, w.r.t. appropriate subsets of M can be obtained simply from the invariance algebras of appropriate subgroups. We also identify the quantum analogues of restriction maps. As a corollary, we prove a well-known "folk theorem," that the algebra A contains only trivial gauge invariant observables w.r.t. a local gauge group acting on E.',

	{'abstract': u'The d-dimensional Hamming torus is the graph whose vertices are all of the integer points inside an a_1 n X a_2 n X ... X a_d n box in R^d (for constants a_1, ..., a_d &gt; 0), and whose edges connect all vertices within Hamming distance one. We study the size of the largest connected component of the subgraph generated by independently removing each vertex of the Hamming torus with probability 1-p. We show that if p= lambda / n, then there exists lambda_c &gt; 0, which is the positive root of a degree d polynomial whose coefficients depend on a_1, ..., a_d, such that for lambda &lt; lambda_c the largest component has O(log n) vertices (a.a.s. as n to infty), and for lambda &gt; lambda_c the largest component has (1-q) lambda ( prod_i a_i) n^ + o(n^) vertices and the second largest component has O(log n) vertices (a.a.s.). An implicit formula for q &lt; 1 is also given. Surprisingly, the value of lambda_c that we find is distinct from the critical value for the emergence of a giant component in the random edge subgraph of the Hamming torus. Additionally, we show that if p = c log n / n, then when c &lt; (d-1) / ( sum a_i) the site subgraph of the Hamming torus is not connected, and when c &gt; (d-1) / ( sum a_i) the subgraph is connected (a.a.s.).

	{'abstract': u'Since the seminal work of Mecke, Nagel and Weiss, the iteration stable (STIT) tessellations have attracted considerable interest in stochastic geometry as a natural and flexible yet analytically tractable model for hierarchical spatial cell-splitting and crack-formation processes. The purpose of this paper is to describe large scale asymptotic geometry of STIT tessellations in and more generally that of non-stationary iteration infinitely divisible tessellations. We study several aspects of the typical first-order geometry of such tessellations resorting to martingale techniques as providing a direct link between the typical characteristics of STIT tessellations and those of suitable mixtures of Poisson hyperplane tessellations. Further, we also consider second-order properties of STIT and iteration infinitely divisible tessellations, such as the variance of the total surface area of cell boundaries inside a convex observation window. Our techniques, relying on martingale theory and tools from integral geometry, allow us to give explicit and asymptotic formulae. Based on these results, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the length/surface increment processes induced by STIT tessellations. We conclude a central limit theorem for total edge length/facet surface, with normal limit distribution in the planar case and non-normal ones in all higher dimensions.',

	{'abstract': u'We extend stochastic network optimization theory to treat networks with arbitrary sample paths for arrivals, channels, and mobility. The network can experience unexpected link or node failures, traffic bursts, and topology changes, and there are no probabilistic assumptions describing these time varying events. Performance of our scheduling algorithm is compared against an ideal T-slot lookahead policy that can make optimal decisions based on knowledge up to T-slots into the future. We develop a simple non-anticipating algorithm that provides network throughput-utility that is arbitrarily close to (or better than) that of the T-slot lookahead policy, with a tradeoff in the worst case queue backlog kept at any queue. The same policy offers even stronger performance, closely matching that of an ideal infinite lookahead policy, when ergodic assumptions are imposed. Our analysis uses a sample path version of Lyapunov drift and provides a methodology for optimizing time averages in general time-varying optimization problems.',

The goal of the paper is to improve this bound. The new count includes emph, i.e., collections of continua or points emph of whose images are pairwise disjoint, contain no critical points, and contain the limit sets of external rays. Also, we relate individual cycles, which are either non-repelling or repelling with no periodic rays landing, to individual critical points that are recurrent in a weak sense. A weak version of the inequality reads [ widetilde N+N_+ chi+ sum_i ( eval(Q_i)-2) le d-1 ] where counts repelling cycles with no periodic rays landing at points in the cycle, form a wandering collection of non-precritical branch continua, if is non-empty, and otherwise.',

	{'abstract': u'We set out a general procedure which allows the approximation of certain Markov chains by the solutions of differential equations. The chains considered have some components which oscillate rapidly and randomly, while others are close to deterministic. The limiting dynamics are obtained by averaging the drift of the latter with respect to a local equilibrium distribution of the former. Some general estimates are proved under a uniform mixing condition on the fast variable which give explicit error probabilities for the fluid approximation. Mitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah [In Proc. 43rd Ann. Symp. Found. Comp. Sci. (2002) 799-808, IEEE] introduced a variant with memory of the "join the shortest queue" or "supermarket" model, and obtained a limit picture for the case of a stable system in which the number of queues and the total arrival rate are large. In this limit, the empirical distribution of queue sizes satisfies a differential equation, while the memory of the system oscillates rapidly and randomly. We illustrate our general fluid limit estimate by giving a proof of this limit picture.',

	{'abstract': u'Some graphs admit drawings in the Euclidean k-space in such a (natu- ral) way, that edges are represented as line segments of unit length. Such drawings will be called k dimensional unit distance representations. When two non-adjacent vertices are drawn in the same point, we say that the representation is degenerate. The dimension (the Euclidean dimension) of a graph is defined to be the minimum integer k needed that a given graph has non-degenerate k dimensional unit distance representation (with the property that non-adjacent vertices are mapped to points, that are not distance one appart). It is proved that deciding if an input graph is homomorphic to a graph with dimension k &gt;= 2 (with the Euclidean dimension k &gt;= 2) are NP-hard problems.',

	{'abstract': u'To the integral symplectic group Sp(2g,Z) we associate two posets of which we prove that they have the Cohen-Macaulay property. As an application we show that the locus of marked decomposable principally polarized abelian varieties in the Siegel space of genus g has the homotopy type of a bouquet of (g-2)-spheres. This, in turn, implies that the rational homology of moduli space of (unmarked) principal polarized abelian varieties of genus g modulo the decomposable ones vanishes in degree g-2 or lower. Another application is an improved stability range for the homology of the symplectic groups over Euclidean rings. But the original motivation comes from envisaged applications to the homology of groups of Torelli type. The proof of our main result rests on a refined nerve theorem for posets that may have an interest in its own right.',

In this article, we will prove that if a thin position of k induces a thin decomposition of double branched cover of (S3,k) by Howards and Schultens' method, then the thin position is the sum of prime summands by stacking a thin position of one of prime summands of k on top of a thin position of another prime summand, and so on. Therefore, k holds the nearly additivity of knot width (i.e. for k = k1#k2, w(k) = w(k1)#w(k2) - 2) in this case. Moreover, we will generalize the hypothesis to the property a thin position induces a manifold decomposition whose thick surfaces consists of strongly irreducible or critical surfaces (so topologically minimal.)",

A compact topological group G admits the structure of a p-adic Lie group if and only if it contains an open pro-p subgroup of finite rank. For every compact p-adic Lie group G the rank rk(G) is greater than or equal to dim(G), where dim(G) denotes the dimension of G as a p-adic manifold. In this paper we consider the converse problem, bounding rk(G) in terms of dim(G). Every profinite group G of finite rank admits a maximal finite normal subgroup, its periodic radical. One of our main results is the following. Let G be a compact p-adic Lie group with trivial periodic radical, and suppose that p is odd. If G has trivial (p-1)-torsion, then rk(G) = dim(G).',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses various questions about pairs of similarity classes of matrices which contain commuting elements. In the case of matrices over finite fields, we show that the problem of determining such pairs reduces to a question about nilpotent classes; this reduction makes use of class types in the sense of Steinberg and Green. We investigate the set of scalars that arise as determinants of elements of the centralizer algebra of a matrix, providing a complete description of this set in terms of the class type of the matrix. Several results are established concerning the commuting of nilpotent classes. Classes which are represented in the centralizer of every nilpotent matrix are classified--this result holds over any field. Nilpotent classes are parametrized by partitions; we find pairs of partitions whose corresponding nilpotent classes commute over some finite fields, but not over others. We conclude by classifying all pairs of classes, parametrized by two-part partitions, that commute. Our results on nilpotent classes complement work of Ko vir and Oblak.',

	{'abstract': u'The existence problem of the total domination vertex critical graphs has been studied in a series of articles. The aim of the present article is twofold. First, we settle the existence problem with respect to the parities of the total domination number m and the maximum degree Delta : for even m except m=4, there is no m-gamma_t-critical graph regardless of the parity of Delta; for m=4 or odd m ge 3 and for even Delta, an m-gamma_t-critical graph exists if and only if Delta ge 2 lfloor frac rfloor; for m=4 or odd m ge 3 and for odd Delta, if Delta ge 2 lfloor frac rfloor +7, then m-gamma_t-critical graphs exist, if Delta &lt; 2 lfloor frac rfloor, then m-gamma_t-critical graphs do not exist. The only remaining open cases are Delta = 2 lfloor frac rfloor +k, k=1, 3, 5. Second, we study these remaining open cases when m=4 or odd m ge 9. As the previously known result for m = 3, we also show that for Delta(G)= 3, 5, 7, there is no 4-gamma_t-critical graph of order Delta(G)+4. On the contrary, it is shown that for odd m ge 9 there exists an m-gamma_t-critical graph for all Delta ge m-1.',

In this setting, noisy versions of one remote source are observed by two nodes with encoders (which is similar to the CEO problem). However, it differs from the CEO problem in that each node must generate multiple descriptions of the source. This problem is of interest in multiple scenarios in efficient communication over networks. In this paper, an achievable region and an outer bound are presented for this problem, which is shown to be sum rate optimal for a class of distortion constraints.',

First we show that a G-spectrum can be replaced by a spectrum obtained by allowing only isotropy groups of prime power order without changing the homotopy type of the completion. We then show that this completion can be computed as a homotopy colimit of completions of spectra obtained by further restricting isotropy to one prime at a time, and that these completions can be computed in terms of completion at a prime. As an application, we show that the spectrum of stable maps from BG to the classifying space of a compact Lie group K splits non-equivariantly as a wedge sum of p-completed suspension spectra of classifying spaces of certain subquotients of the product of G and K. In particular this describes the dual of BG.',

It is known that the operator norms of these commutators can be controlled by the norm of the commutator with appropriate Haar shift operators, and we prove the estimate for these commutators. For the shift operator corresponding to the Hilbert transform we use Bellman function methods, however there is now a general theorem for a class of Haar shift operators that can be used instead to deduce similar results. We invoke this general theorem to obtain the corresponding result for the Riesz transforms and the Beurling-Ahlfors operator. We can then extrapolate to Lp(w), and the results are sharp for 1 &lt; p &lt; 1.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper we try to find examples of integrable natural Hamiltonian systems on the sphere with the symmetries of each Platonic polyhedra. Although some of these systems are known, their expression is extremely complicated; we try here to find the simplest possible expressions for this kind of dynamical systems. Even in the simplest cases it is not easy to prove their integrability by direct computation of the first integrals, therefore, we make use of numerical methods to provide evidences of integrability; namely, by analyzing their Poincar 'e sections (surface sections). In this way we find three systems with platonic symmetries, one for each class of equivalent Platonic polyhedra: tetrahedral, exahedral-octahedral, dodecahedral-icosahedral, showing evidences of integrability. The proof of integrability and the construction of the first integrals are left for further works. As an outline of the possible developments if the integrability of these systems will be proved, we show how to build from them new integrable systems in dimension three and, from these, superintegrable systems in dimension four corresponding to superintegrable interactions among four points on a line, in analogy with the systems with dihedral symmetry treated in a previous article. A common feature of these possibly integrable systems is, besides to the rich symmetry group on the configuration manifold, the partition of the latter into dynamically separated regions showing a simple structure of the potential in their interior. This observation allows to conjecture integrability for a class of Hamiltonian systems in the Euclidean spaces.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider the group lasso penalty for the linear model. We note that the standard algorithm for solving the problem assumes that the model matrices in each group are orthonormal. Here we consider a more general penalty that blends the lasso (L1) with the group lasso ("two-norm"). This penalty yields solutions that are sparse at both the group and individual feature levels. We derive an efficient algorithm for the resulting convex problem based on coordinate descent. This algorithm can also be used to solve the general form of the group lasso, with non-orthonormal model matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the Yetter--Drinfeld D(B)-module algebra structure on the Heisenberg double H(B^*) endowed with a "heterotic" action of the Drinfeld double D(B). This action can be interpreted in the spirit of Lu\'s description of H(B^*) as a twist of D(B). In terms of the braiding of Yetter--Drinfeld modules, H(B^*) is braided commutative. By the Brzezinski--Militaru theorem, H(B^*)#D(B) is then a Hopf algebroid over H(B^*). For B a particular Taft Hopf algebra at a 2p-th root of unity, the construction is adapted to yield Yetter--Drinfeld module algebras over the 2p^3-dimensional quantum group U_q(sl(2)). In particular, it follows that Mat_p(C) is a braided commutative Yetter--Drinfeld U_q(sl(2))-module algebra and Mat_p(U_q(sl(2))) is a Hopf algebroid over Mat_p(C).',

	{'abstract': u"Physical systems exhibiting stochastic or chaotic behavior are often amenable to treatment by random matrix models. In deciding on a good choice of model, random matrix physics is constrained and guided by symmetry considerations. The notion of 'symmetry class' (not to be confused with 'universality class') expresses the relevance of symmetries as an organizational principle. Dyson, in his 1962 paper referred to as the Threefold Way, gave the prime classification of random matrix ensembles based on a quantum mechanical setting with symmetries. In this article we review Dyson's Threefold Way from a modern perspective. We then describe a minimal extension of Dyson's setting to incorporate the physics of chiral Dirac fermions and disordered superconductors. In this minimally extended setting, where Hilbert space is replaced by Fock space equipped with the anti-unitary operation of particle-hole conjugation, symmetry classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the large families of Riemannian symmetric spaces.",

	{'abstract': u"This paper addresses an interference channel consisting of active users sharing frequency sub-bands. Users are asynchronous meaning there exists a mutual delay between their transmitted codes. A stationary model for interference is considered by assuming the starting point of an interferer's data is uniformly distributed along the codeword of any user. The spectrum is divided to private and common bands each containing and frequency sub-bands respectively. We consider a scenario where all transmitters are unaware of the number of active users and the channel gains. The optimum and are obtained such that the so-called outage capacity per user is maximized. If , upper and lower bounds on the mutual information between the input and output of the channel for each user are derived using a genie-aided technique. The proposed bounds meet each other as the code length grows to infinity yielding a closed expression for the achievable rates. If , all users follow a locally Randomized On-Off signaling scheme on the common band where each transmitter quits transmitting its Gaussian signals independently from transmission to transmission. Using a conditional version of Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) and an upper bound on the differential entropy of a mixed Gaussian random variable, lower bounds on the achievable rates of users are developed. Thereafter, the activation probability on each transmission slot is designed resulting in the largest outage capacity.",

I try here to discuss the problem from scratch, showing that the rarity of the name plays no role, unless the strange assumption of two identical names in the same family is taken into account. But also the name itself does not matter. What is really important is `identification\', meant in an acceptation broader than usual, in the sense that a child is characterized by a set of attributes that make him/her uniquely identifiable (`that one\') inside a family. The important point of how the information is acquired is also commented, suggesting an explanation of why several people tend to consider the informations "at least one boy" and "a well defined boy" (elder/youngest or of a given name) equivalent.',

	{'abstract': u'Summation methods play a very important role in quantum field theory because all perturbation series are divergent and the expansion parameter is not always small. A number of methods have been tried in this context, most notably Pade approximants, Borel--Pade summation, Borel transformation with mapping, which we briefly describe and one on which we concentrate here, Order-Dependent Mapping (ODM). We recall the basis of the method, for a class of series we give intuitive arguments to explain its convergence and illustrate its properties by several simple examples. Since the method was proposed, some rigorous convergence proofs were given. The method has also found a number of applications and we shall list a few.',

For objects of both types we find the limit joint distributions of blocks and give their Hilbert space realizations, using operators called `matricially free Gaussian operators'. In particular, if the variance matrices are symmetric, the asymptotics of symmetric blocks of random pseudomatrices agrees with that of symmetric random blocks. We also show that blocks of random pseudomatrices are `asymptotically matricially free' whereas the corresponding symmetric random blocks are `asymptotically symmetrically matricially free', where symmetric matricial freeness is obtained from matricial freeness by an operation of symmetrization. Finally, we show that row blocks of square, lower-block-triangular and block-diagonal pseudomatrices are asymptotically free, monotone independent and boolean independent, respectively.",

	{'abstract': u'The Veldkamp space, in the sense of Buekenhout and Cohen, of the generalized quadrangle GQ(4, 2) is shown not to be a (partial) linear space by simply giving several examples of Veldkamp lines (V-lines) having two or even three Veldkamp points (V-points) in common. Alongside the ordinary V-lines of size five, one also finds V-lines of cardinality three and two. There, however, exists a subspace of the Veldkamp space isomorphic to PG(3, 4) having 45 perps and 40 plane ovoids as its 85 V-points, with its 357 V-lines being of four distinct types. A V-line of the first type consists of five perps on a common line (altogether 27 of them), the second type features three perps and two ovoids sharing a tricentric triad (240 members), whilst the third and fourth type each comprises a perp and four ovoids in the rosette centered at the (common) center of the perp (90). It is also pointed out that 160 non-plane ovoids (tripods) fall into two distinct orbits -- of sizes 40 and 120 -- with respect to the stabilizer group of a copy of GQ(2, 2); a tripod of the first/second orbit sharing with the GQ(2, 2) a tricentric/unicentric triad, respectively. Finally, three remarkable subconfigurations of V-lines represented by fans of ovoids through a fixed ovoid are examined in some detail.',

In this paper we generalize the construction of the refined analytic torsion to the twisted de Rham complex. We show that the refined analytic torsion of the twisted de Rham complex is independent of the choice of the Riemannian metric on and the Hermitian metric on . We also show that the twisted refined analytic torsion is invariant (under a natural identification) if is deformed within its cohomology class. We prove a duality theorem, establishing a relationship between the twisted refined analytic torsion corresponding to a flat connection and its dual. We also define the twisted analogue of the Ray-Singer metric and calculate the twisted Ray-Singer metric of the twisted refined analytic torsion. In particular we show that in case that the Hermtitian connection is flat, the twisted refined analytic torsion is an element with the twisted Ray-Singer norm one.',

The first is the analogue of the surgery exact triangle proved by Ozsvath and Szabo for the Heegaard-Floer invariant HF^+; for the lattice cohomology over Z_2-coefficients it was proved by J. Greene. Here we prove it over the integers, and we supplement it by some additional properties valid for negative definite graphs. The second exact sequence is an adapted version which does not mix the classes of the characteristic elements (spin^c-structures); it was partially motivated by the surgery formula for the Seiberg-Witten invariant obtained by Braun and the author. For this we define the `relative lattice cohomology' and we also determine its Euler characteristic in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants.",

We proceed as follows: We select one source/sink pair among the n distinguished source/sink pairs at a time and treat the given multicommodity network as a single commodity network for such chosen source/sink pair. Then applying standard labeling algorithm, separately for each sink/source pair, the feasible flow which is max flow and the corresponding minimum cut corresponding to each source/sink pair is obtained. A record is made of these cuts and the paths flowing through the edges of these cuts. This record is then utilized to develop our algorithm to obtain max flow for multicommodity flow. In this paper we have pinpointed the difficulty behind not getting a max flow min cut type theorem for multicommodity flow and found out a remedy.',

Zhou [17]. Then, we study the applications of the polynomial identity (1) obtained in theorem 1.1 of this paper. We show the proof Bouchard-Mari ~no conjecture for C^3 which was given by L. Chen [5] Firstly. Subsequently, we will present how to obtain series Hodge integral identities from this polynomial identity (1). In particular, the main result in [9] is one of special case in such series of Hodge integral identities.

A similar, though slightly larger bound holds for odd. The results are shown using a version of Stein's method for bounded, monotone size bias couplings. The argument for even depends on the construction of a variable on the same space as that has the -size bias distribution, that is, that satisfies beas E [X g(X)] = mu E[g(X^s)] quad for all bounded continuous , enas and for which there exists a , in this case B=2, such that almost surely. The argument for odd is similar to that for even, but one first couples closely to , a symmetrized version of , for which a size bias coupling of to can proceed as in the even case. In both the even and odd cases, the crucial calculation of the variance of a conditional expectation requires detailed information on the spectral decomposition of the lightbulb chain.",

	{'abstract': u'The cover time of a graph is a celebrated example of a parameter that is easy to approximate using a randomized algorithm, but for which no constant factor deterministic polynomial time approximation is known. A breakthrough due to Kahn, Kim, Lovasz and Vu yielded a (log log n)^2 polynomial time approximation. We refine this upper bound, and show that the resulting bound is sharp and explicitly computable in random graphs. Cooper and Frieze showed that the cover time of the largest component of the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,c/n) in the supercritical regime with c&gt;1 fixed, is asymptotic to f(c) n log^2 n, where f(c) tends to 1 as c tends to 1. However, our new bound implies that the cover time for the critical Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,1/n) has order n, and shows how the cover time evolves from the critical window to the supercritical phase. Our general estimate also yields the order of the cover time for a variety of other concrete graphs, including critical percolation clusters on the Hamming hypercube ^n, on high-girth expanders, and on tori Z_n^d for fixed large d. For the graphs we consider, our results show that the blanket time, introduced by Winkler and Zuckerman, is within a constant factor of the cover time. Finally, we prove that for any connected graph, adding an edge can increase the cover time by at most a factor of 4.',

For example: the density of a product of not-too-many compact linear orders never exceeds its Noetherian type, with equality possible only for singular Noetherian types; we prove a similar result for products of Lindelof GO-spaces. A countable product of compact linear orders has an omega_1^op-like base if and only if it is metrizable, and every metrizable space has an omega^op-like base. An infinite cardinal k is the Noetherian type of a compact LOTS if and only if k is not omega_1 and k is not weakly inaccessible.

As one of the examples the Maxwell system for an inhomogeneous medium is considered, and as one of the consequences of the introduced approach we find a relation between the time-dependent one-dimensional Maxwell system and hyperbolic pseudoanalytic functions and obtain an infinite system of solutions of the Maxwell system. Other considered examples are the system describing force-free magnetic fields and the Dirac system from relativistic quantum mechanics.",

Combin. 16 (2009), #N9) one obtains a direct proof of the nonvanishing-version of Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz for polynomials over an arbitrary integral domain. The proof relies on Cramer's rule and Vandermonde's determinant to explicitly describe a map used by Kouba in terms of cofactors of a certain matrix. That the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz is true over integral domains is a well-known fact which is already contained in Alon's work and emphasized in recent articles of Michalek and Schauz; the sole purpose of the present note is to point out that not only is it not necessary to invoke duality of vector spaces, but by not doing so one easily obtains a more general result.",

The argument combines a numerical criterion for good formal structures from a previous paper, with an analysis based on the geometry of an associated valuation space (Riemann-Zariski space). We obtain a similar result over the formal completion of an excellent scheme along a closed subscheme. If we replace the excellent scheme by a complex analytic variety, we obtain a similar but weaker result in which the blowup can only be constructed in a small neighborhood of a prescribed point.',

For nonsmooth "viscosity" solutions, which give rise to discontinuous velocity fields, this description is usually pursued only up to the moment when trajectories hit a shock and cease to minimize the Lagrangian action. In this paper we show that for any convex Hamiltonian there exists a uniquely defined canonical global nonsmooth coalescing flow that extends particle trajectories and determines dynamics inside the shocks. We also provide a variational description of the corresponding effective velocity field inside shocks, and discuss relation to the "dissipative anomaly" in the limit of vanishing viscosity.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, first by employing inequalities derived from the Opial inequality due to David Boyd with best constant, we will establish new unconditional lower bounds for the gaps between the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Second, on the hypothesis that the moments of the Hardy Z-function and its derivatives are correctly predicted, we establish some explicit formulae for the lower bounds of the gaps between the zeros and use them to establish some new conditional bounds. In particular it is proved that the consecutive nontrivial zeros often differ by at least 6.1392 (conditionally) times the average spacing. This value improves the value 4.71474396 that has been derived in the literature.',

	{'abstract': u'We place ourselves in the setting of high-dimensional statistical inference where the number of variables in a dataset of interest is of the same order of magnitude as the number of observations . We consider the spectrum of certain kernel random matrices, in particular matrices whose th entry is or where is the dimension of the data, and are independent data vectors. Here is assumed to be a locally smooth function. The study is motivated by questions arising in statistics and computer science where these matrices are used to perform, among other things, nonlinear versions of principal component analysis. Surprisingly, we show that in high-dimensions, and for the models we analyze, the problem becomes essentially linear--which is at odds with heuristics sometimes used to justify the usage of these methods. The analysis also highlights certain peculiarities of models widely studied in random matrix theory and raises some questions about their relevance as tools to model high-dimensional data encountered in practice.',

	{'abstract': u'A module over the tropical semifield is analogous to a module over a field. We assume that is straight reflexive, and define the dimension of to the number of elements of a basis. We study the dimension of a straight reflexive submodule . Also we find an enough condition to the reflexivity. This result has an application to polytopes in a tropical projective space, and also to a Riemann-Roch theorem for tropical curves.',

	{'abstract': u'For the resolved conifold with one outer D-brane in arbitrary framing, we present some results for the open string partition functions obtained by some operator manipulations. We prove some conjectures by Aganagic-Vafa and Aganagic-Klemm-Vafa that relates such invariants to the mirror curve of the resolved conifold. This establishes local mirror symmetry for the resolved confolds for holomorphic disc invariants. We also verify an integrality conjecture of such invariants by Ooguri-Vafa in this case and present closed formulas for some Ooguri-Vafa type invariants in genus 0 and arbitrary genera.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a theory of backward stochastic differential equations in continuous time with an arbitrary filtered probability space. No assumptions are made regarding the left continuity of the filtration, of the predictable quadratic variations of martingales or of the measure integrating the driver. We present conditions for existence and uniqueness of square-integrable solutions, using Lipschitz continuity of the driver. These conditions unite the requirements for existence in continuous and discrete time and allow discrete processes to be embedded with continuous ones. We also present conditions for a comparison theorem and hence construct time consistent nonlinear expectations in these general spaces.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a new algorithm to compute the classical modular polynomial Phi_n in the rings Z[X,Y] and (Z/mZ)[X,Y], for a prime n and any positive integer m. Our approach uses the graph of n-isogenies to efficiently compute Phi_n mod p for many primes p of a suitable form, and then applies the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we achieve an expected running time of O(n^3 (log n)^3 log log n), and compute Phi_n mod m using O(n^2 (log n)^2 + n^2 log m) space. We have used the new algorithm to compute Phi_n with n over 5000, and Phi_n mod m with n over 20000. We also consider several modular functions g for which Phi_n^g is smaller than Phi_n, allowing us to handle n over 60000.',

	{'abstract': u'The present paper is a review of the current state of Graph-Link Theory (graph-links are also closely related to homotopy classes of looped interlacement graphs), dealing with a generalisation of knots obtained by translating the Reidemeister moves for links into the language of intersection graphs of chord diagrams. In this paper we show how some methods of classical and virtual knot theory can be translated into the language of abstract graphs, and some theorems can be reproved and generalised to this graphical setting. We construct various invariants, prove certain minimality theorems and construct functorial mappings for graph-knots and graph-links. In this paper, we first show non-equivalence of some graph-links to virtual links.',

	{'abstract': u'For a two-user Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), a well known orthogonal-multiple-access (O-MA) scheme has been preferred to non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NO-MA) schemes since FDMA can achieve the sum-capacity of the channel with only single-user decoding complexity [ emph]. However, with finite alphabets, in this paper, we show that NO-MA is better than O-MA for a two-user GMAC. We plot the constellation constrained (CC) capacity regions of a two-user GMAC with FDMA and time division multiple access (TDMA) and compare them with the CC capacity regions with trellis coded multiple access (TCMA), a recently introduced NO-MA scheme. Unlike the Gaussian alphabets case, it is shown that the CC capacity region with FDMA is strictly contained inside the CC capacity region with TCMA. In particular, for a given bandwidth, the gap between the CC capacity regions with TCMA and FDMA is shown to increase with the increase in the average power constraint. Also, for a given power constraint, the gap between the CC capacity regions with TCMA and FDMA is shown to decrease with the increase in the bandwidth. Hence, for finite alphabets, a NO-MA scheme such as TCMA is better than the well known O-MAC schemes, FDMA and TDMA which makes NO-MA schemes worth pursuing in practice for a two-user GMAC.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we give a quantum statistical interpretation for the bracket polynomial state sum &lt;K&gt; and for the Jones polynomial. We use this quantum mechanical interpretation to give a new quantum algorithm for computing the Jones polynomial. This algorithm is useful for its conceptual simplicity, and it applies to all values of the polynomial variable that lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. Letting C(K) denote the Hilbert space for this model, there is a natural unitary transformation U from C(K) to itself such that &lt;K&gt; = &lt;F|U|F&gt; where |F&gt; is a sum over basis states for C(K). The quantum algorithm arises directly from this formula via the Hadamard Test. We then show that the framework for our quantum model for the bracket polynomial is a natural setting for Khovanov homology. The Hilbert space C(K) of our model has basis in one-to-one correspondence with the enhanced states of the bracket state summmation and is isomorphic with the chain complex for Khovanov homology with coefficients in the complex numbers. We show that for the Khovanov boundary operator d defined on C(K) we have the relationship dU + Ud = 0. Consequently, the unitary operator U acts on the Khovanov homology, and we therefore obtain a direct relationship between Khovanov homology and this quantum algorithm for the Jones polynomial. The formula for the Jones polynomial as a graded Euler characteristic is now expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of U and the Euler characteristics of the eigenspaces of U in the homology. The quantum algorithm given here is inefficient, and so it remains an open problem to determine better quantum algorithms that involve both the Jones polynomial and the Khovanov homology.',

	{'abstract': u'To a maximal torus in a quasi-split semi-simple simply-connected group over a local field of characteristic 0, Langlands and Shelstad construct a cohomological invariant called the splitting invariant, which is an important component of their endoscopic transfer factors. We study this invariant in the case of a split real group and prove a decomposition theorem which expresses this invariant for a general torus as a product of the corresponding invariants for simple tori. We also show how this reduction formula allows for the comparison of splitting invariants between different tori in the given real group.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we quantify the benefits of employing relay station in large-coverage cognitive radio systems which opportunistically access the licensed spectrum of some small-coverage primary systems scattered inside. Through analytical study, we show that even a simple decode-and-forward (SDF) relay, which can hold only one packet, offers significant path-loss gain in terms of the spatial transmission opportunities and link reliability. However, such scheme fails to capture the spatial-temporal burstiness of the primary activities, that is, when either the source-relay (SR) link or relay-destination (RD) link is blocked by the primary activities, the cognitive spectrum access has to stop. To overcome this obstacle, we further propose buffered decode-and-forward (BDF) protocol. By exploiting the infinitely long buffer at the relay, the blockage time on either SR or RD link is saved for cognitive spectrum access. The buffer gain is shown analytically to improve the stability region and average end-to-end delay performance of the cognitive relay system.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents several novel theoretical results regarding the recovery of a low-rank matrix from just a few measurements consisting of linear combinations of the matrix entries. We show that properly constrained nuclear-norm minimization stably recovers a low-rank matrix from a constant number of noisy measurements per degree of freedom; this seems to be the first result of this nature. Further, the recovery error from noisy data is within a constant of three targets: 1) the minimax risk, 2) an oracle error that would be available if the column space of the matrix were known, and 3) a more adaptive oracle error which would be available with the knowledge of the column space corresponding to the part of the matrix that stands above the noise. Lastly, the error bounds regarding low-rank matrices are extended to provide an error bound when the matrix has full rank with decaying singular values. The analysis in this paper is based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) introduced in [6] for vectors, and in [22] for matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'Given a simplicial complex with weights on its simplices, and a nontrivial cycle on it, we are interested in finding the cycle with minimal weight which is homologous to the given one. Assuming that the homology is defined with integer coefficients, we show the following : For a finite simplicial complex of dimension greater than , the boundary matrix is totally unimodular if and only if is torsion-free, for all pure subcomplexes in of dimensions and respectively, where is a subset of . Because of the total unimodularity of the boundary matrix, we can solve the optimization problem, which is inherently an integer programming problem, as a linear program and obtain integer solution. Thus the problem of finding optimal cycles in a given homology class can be solved in polynomial time. This result is surprising in the backdrop of a recent result which says that the problem is NP-hard under coefficients which, being a field, is in general easier to deal with. One consequence of our result, among others, is that one can compute in polynomial time an optimal 2-cycle in a given homology class for any finite simplicial complex embedded in . Our optimization approach can also be used for various related problems, such as finding an optimal chain homologous to a given one when these are not cycles.',

	{'abstract': u"In this note we study and compare three graph invariants related to the 'compactness' of graph drawing in the plane: the dilation coefficient, defined as the smallest possible quotient between the longest and the shortest edge length; the plane-width, which is the smallest possible quotient between the largest distance between any two points and the shortest length of an edge; and the resolution coefficient, the smallest possible quotient between the longest edge length and the smallest distance between any two points. These three invariants coincide for complete graphs. We show that graphs with large dilation coefficient or plane-width have a vertex with large valence but there exist cubic graphs with arbitrarily large resolution coefficient. Surprisingly enough, the one-dimensional analogues of these three invariants allow us to revisit the three well known graph parameters: the circular chromatic number, the chromatic number, and the bandwidth. We also examine the connection between bounded resolution coefficient and minor-closed graph classes.",

	{'abstract': u'In the last decade, the perfectly matched layer (PML) approach has proved a flexible and accurate method for the simulation of waves in unbounded media. Most PML formulations, however, usually require wave equations stated in their standard second-order form to be reformulated as first-order systems, thereby introducing many additional unknowns. To circumvent this cumbersome and somewhat expensive step, we instead propose a simple PML formulation directly for the wave equation in its second-order form. Inside the absorbing layer, our formulation requires only two auxiliary variables in two space dimensions and four auxiliary variables in three space dimensions; hence it is cheap to implement. Since our formulation requires no higher derivatives, it is also easily coupled with standard finite difference or finite element methods. Strong stability is proved while numerical examples in two and three space dimensions illustrate the accuracy and long time stability of our PML formulation.',

We linearize the BTK algorithm and show that it produces an explicit symmetric Jordan basis (SJB). In the special case of a Boolean algebra the resulting SJB is orthogonal with respect to the standard inner product and, moreover, we can write down an explicit formula for the ratio of the lengths of the successive vectors in these chains (i.e., the singular values). This yields a new, constructive proof of the explicit block diagonalization of the Terwilliger algebra of the binary Hamming scheme. We also give a representation theoretic characterization of this basis that explains its orthogonality, namely, that it is the canonically defined (upto scalars) symmetric Gelfand-Tsetlin basis.',

	{'abstract': u'Among the methods for solving ODE-IVPs, the class of General Linear Methods (GLMs) is able to encompass most of them, ranging from Linear Multistep Formulae (LMF) to RK formulae. Moreover, it is possible to obtain methods able to overcome typical drawbacks of the previous classes of methods. For example, order barriers for stable LMF and the problem of order reduction for RK methods. Nevertheless, these goals are usually achieved at the price of a higher computational cost. Consequently, many efforts have been made in order to derive GLMs with particular features, to be exploited for their efficient implementation. In recent years, the derivation of GLMs from particular Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), namely the family of Generalized BDF (GBDF), has been proposed for the numerical solution of stiff ODE-IVPs. In particular, this approach has been recently developed, resulting in a new family of L-stable GLMs of arbitrarily high order, whose theory is here completed and fully worked-out. Moreover, for each one of such methods, it is possible to define a corresponding Blended GLM which is equivalent to it from the point of view of the stability and order properties. These blended methods, in turn, allow the definition of efficient nonlinear splittings for solving the generated discrete problems. A few numerical tests, confirming the excellent potential of such blended methods, are also reported.',

One of the families is assumed to be amenable to `separation of variables' and the other one not. With certain additional assumptions, we show that if the families are asymptotic at first order as t tends to 0, then the generic spectral simplicity of the separable family implies that the eigenbranches of the second family are also generically one-dimensional. As an application, we prove that for the generic triangle (simplex) in Euclidean space (constant curvature space form) each eigenspace of the Laplacian is one-dimensional. We also show that for all but countably many t, the geodesic triangle in the hyperbolic plane with interior angles 0, t, and t, has simple spectrum.",

	{'abstract': u"A purely state-dependent cost function can be modified by introducing a control-dependent term rewarding submaximal control utilization. A moderation incentive is identically zero on the boundary of the admissible control region and non-negative on the interior; it is bounded above by the infimum of the state-dependent cost function, so that the instantaneous total cost is always non-negative. The conservation law determined by the Maximum Principle, in combination with the condition that the moderation incentive equal zero on the boundary of the admissible control region, plays a crucial role in the analysis; in some situations, the initial and final values of the auxiliary variable are uniquely determined by the condition that the conserved quantity equal zero along a solution of the arbitrary duration synthesis problem. Use of an alternate system of evolution equations, parametrized by the auxiliary variable, for one-degree of freedom controlled acceleration systems, can significantly simplify numerical searches for solutions of the arbitrary duration synthesis problem. A one-parameter family of 'elliptical' moderation incentives is introduced; the behavior of the well-known quadratic control cost and its incentive analog is compared to that of the elliptical incentives in two simple controlled acceleration examples. The elliptical incentives yield smooth solutions with controls remaining in the interior of the admissible region, while the quadratic incentive allows piecewise smooth solutions with controls moving on and off the boundary of the admissible region; in these examples, the arbitrary duration synthesis problem for the traditional quadratic control cost has no solution; the total cost is a monotonically decreasing function of the duration.",

Wyner showed that the situation is characterized by a single constant C_s, called the secrecy capacity, which has the following meaning: for all , there exist coding schemes of rate that asymptotically achieve both the reliability and the security objectives. However, his proof of this result is based upon a nonconstructive random-coding argument. To date, despite a considerable research effort, the only case where we know how to construct coding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when Eve's channel C_2 is an erasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof. Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and decoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme that achieves the secrecy capacity for a wide range of wiretap channels. Our construction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as long as both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and binary-input, and C_2 is degraded with respect to C_1. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to provide strong security, in the sense defined by Maurer, while still operating at a rate that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot guarantee that the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main channel C_1 is noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in practice.",

	{'abstract': u'We formulate and investigate a general stochastic control problem under a progressive enlargement of filtration. The global information is enlarged from a reference filtration and the knowledge of multiple random times together with associated marks when they occur. By working under a density hypothesis on the conditional joint distribution of the random times and marks, we prove a decomposition of the original stochastic control problem under the global filtration into classical stochastic control problems under the reference filtration, which are determined in a finite backward induction. Our method revisits and extends in particular stochastic control of diffusion processes with finite number of jumps. This study is motivated by optimization problems arising in default risk management, and we provide applications of our decomposition result for the indifference pricing of defaultable claims, and the optimal investment under bilateral counterparty risk. The solutions are expressed in terms of BSDEs involving only Brownian filtration, and remarkably without jump terms coming from the default times and marks in the global filtration.',

	{'abstract': u'We discuss contact invariant structures on the space of solutions of a third-order ordinary differential equation. Associated to any third-order differential equation modulo contact transformations, Chern introduced a degenerate conformal Lorentzian metric on the space of 2-jets of functions of one variable. When the Wuenschmann invariant vanishes, the degenerate metric descends to a proper conformal Lorentzian metric on the space of solutions. In the general case, when the Wuenschmann invariant is not zero, we define the notion of a causal geometry, and show that the space of solutions supports one. The Wuenschmann invariant is then related to the projective curvature of the indicatrix curve cut out by the causal geometry in the projective tangent space. When the Wuenschmann vanishes, the causal structure is then precisely the sheaf of null geodesics of the Chern conformal structure. We then introduce a Lagrangian and associated Hamiltonian from which the degenerate conformal Lorentzian metric are constructed. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a rank three degenerate conformal Lorentzian metric in four dimensions to correspond to a third-order differential equation.',

	{'abstract': u'In this article we study post-model selection estimators that apply ordinary least squares (OLS) to the model selected by first-step penalized estimators, typically Lasso. It is well known that Lasso can estimate the nonparametric regression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve upon. We show that the OLS post-Lasso estimator performs at least as well as Lasso in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller bias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the Lasso-based model selection "fails" in the sense of missing some components of the "true" regression model. By the "true" model, we mean the best s-dimensional approximation to the nonparametric regression function chosen by the oracle. Furthermore, OLS post-Lasso estimator can perform strictly better than Lasso, in the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the Lasso-based model selection correctly includes all components of the "true" model as a subset and also achieves sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when Lasso perfectly selects the "true" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on the dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the "true" model. Our rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso estimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other estimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and good sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and a new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit. The latter scheme has theoretical guarantees similar to those of Lasso or OLS post-Lasso, but it dominates those procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide variety of experiments.',

	{'abstract': u'A framework is a graph and a map from its vertices to E^d (for some d). A framework is universally rigid if any framework in any dimension with the same graph and edge lengths is a Euclidean image of it. We show that a generic universally rigid framework has a positive semi-definite stress matrix of maximal rank. Connelly showed that the existence of such a positive semi-definite stress matrix is sufficient for universal rigidity, so this provides a characterization of universal rigidity for generic frameworks. We also extend our argument to give a new result on the genericity of strict complementarity in semidefinite programming.',

	{'abstract': u'Jolissaint and Stalder introduced definitions of mixing and weak mixing for von Neumann subalgebras of finite von Neumann algebras. In this note, we study various algebraic and analytical properties of subalgebras with these mixing properties. We prove some basic results about mixing inclusions of von Neumann algebras and establish a connection between mixing properties and normalizers of von Neumann subalgebras. The special case of mixing subalgebras arising from inclusions of countable discrete groups finds applications to ergodic theory, in particular, a new generalization of a classical theorem of Halmos on the automorphisms of a compact abelian group. For a finite von Neumann algebra and von Neumann subalgebras , of , we introduce a notion of weak mixing of relative to . We show that weak mixing of relative to is equivalent to the following property: if and there exist a finite number of elements such that , then . We conclude the paper with an assortment of further examples of mixing subalgebras arising from the amalgamated free product and crossed product constructions.',

	{'abstract': u"A write-once memory (wom) is a storage medium formed by a number of ``write-once'' bit positions (wits), where each wit initially is in a `0' state and can be changed to a `1' state irreversibly. Examples of write-once memories include SLC flash memories and optical disks. This paper presents a low complexity coding scheme for rewriting such write-once memories, which is applicable to general problem configurations. The proposed scheme is called the emph, as it uses the positions of the zero symbols to encode some information. The proposed technique can achieve code rates higher than state-of-the-art practical solutions for some configurations. For instance, there is a position modulation code that can write 56 bits 10 times on 278 wits, achieving rate 2.01. In addition, the position modulation code is shown to achieve a rate at least half of the optimal rate.",

	{'abstract': u'The recent extensions of domain theory have proved particularly efficient to study lattice-valued maxitive measures, when the target lattice is continuous. Maxitive measures are defined analogously to classical measures with the supremum operation in place of the addition. Building further on the links between domain theory and idempotent analysis highlighted by Lawson (2004), we investigate the concept of domain-valued linear forms on an idempotent (semi)module. In addition to proving representation theorems for continuous linear forms, we address two applications: the idempotent Radon--Nikodym theorem and the idempotent Riesz representation theorem. To unify similar results from different mathematical areas, our analysis is carried out in the general Z framework of domain theory.',

	{'abstract': u'In cite one-parameter planar motion was first introduced and the relations between absolute, relative, sliding velocities (and accelerations) in the Euclidean plane were obtained. Moreover, the relations between the Complex velocities one-parameter motion in the Complex plane were provided by cite. One-parameter planar homothetic motion was defined in the Complex plane, cite. In this paper, analogous to homothetic motion in the Complex plane given by cite, one-parameter planar homothetic motion is defined in the Hyperbolic plane. Some characteristic properties about the velocity vectors, the acceleration vectors and the pole curves are given. Moreover, in the case of homothetic scale identically equal to 1, the results given in cite are obtained as a special case. In addition, three hyperbolic planes, of which two are moving and the other one is fixed, are taken into consideration and a canonical relative system for one-parameter planar hyperbolic homothetic motion is defined. Euler-Savary formula, which gives the relationship between the curvatures of trajectory curves, is obtained with the help of this relative system.',

	{'abstract': u'The high repair cost of (n,k) Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) erasure codes has recently motivated a new class of codes, called Regenerating Codes, that optimally trade off storage cost for repair bandwidth. On one end of this spectrum of Regenerating Codes are Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes that can match the minimum storage cost of MDS codes while also significantly reducing repair bandwidth. In this paper, we describe Exact-MSR codes which allow for any failed nodes (whether they are systematic or parity nodes) to be regenerated exactly rather than only functionally or information-equivalently. We show that Exact-MSR codes come with no loss of optimality with respect to random-network-coding based MSR codes (matching the cutset-based lower bound on repair bandwidth) for the cases of: (a) k/n &lt;= 1/2; and (b) k &lt;= 3. Our constructive approach is based on interference alignment techniques, and, unlike the previous class of random-network-coding based approaches, we provide explicit and deterministic coding schemes that require a finite-field size of at most 2(n-k).',

	{'abstract': u'Asymptotics of the variances of many cost measures in random digital search trees are often notoriously messy and involved to obtain. A new approach is proposed to facilitate such an analysis for several shape parameters on random symmetric digital search trees. Our approach starts from a more careful normalization at the level of Poisson generating functions, which then provides an asymptotically equivalent approximation to the variance in question. Several new ingredients are also introduced such as a combined use of the Laplace and Mellin transforms and a simple, mechanical technique for justifying the analytic de-Poissonization procedures involved. The methodology we develop can be easily adapted to many other problems with an underlying binomial distribution. In particular, the less expected and somewhat surprising -variance for certain notions of total path-length is also clarified.',

	{'abstract': u'An unknown-position sensor can be localized if there are three or more anchors making time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements of a signal from it. However, the location errors can be very large due to the fact that some of the measurements are from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, we propose a semi-definite programming (SDP) based node localization algorithm in NLOS environment for ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless sensor networks. The positions of sensors can be estimated using the distance estimates from location-aware anchors as well as other sensors. However, in the absence of LOS paths, e.g., in indoor networks, the NLOS range estimates can be significantly biased. As a result, the NLOS error can remarkably decrease the location accuracy. And it is not easy to efficiently distinguish LOS from NLOS measurements. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed that achieves high location accuracy without the need of identifying NLOS and LOS measurement.',

	{'abstract': u'The phase-integral method (PIM) is an asymptotic method of the geometrical optics or semi-classical type for solving approximately, but in many cases very accurately, a wide class of differential equations in physics. Unlike the related (J)WKB method, the higher-order corrections in the PIM can be generated from a generic, unspecified base function, providing added symmetry and flexibility. However, with the conventional approach of using the next-to-lowest (third) order correction to the integrand in the phase integral as a platform for calculating higher (fifth, seventh, ninth,...) order corrections, the higher-order calculations very often become quite complicated. We therefore introduce a new platform function, which considerably simplifies the calculation of the third-order contribution for a wide range of problems. We also present directly integrable conditions for the phase integral, which so far seem to have gone unnoticed. For a large number of observables, our analysis makes a clearer distinction between physical and, in a sense, unphysical contributions.',

Distance from the null vector in the grid graph defines a Manhattan norm. The Hermitian inner product on these spaces over finite fields behaves in some respects similarly to the real and complex case. An analogue of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is valid with respect to the Manhattan norm. With respect to the non-transitive order provided by the quadratic residue tournament, an analogue of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds in arbitrarily large neighborhoods of the null vector, when the characteristic is an appropriate large prime.',

However, proofs of existence of such subspaces were probabilistic, hence non-constructive, which made the results not-quite-suitable for subsequently discovered applications to high-dimensional nearest neighbor search, error-correcting codes over the reals, compressive sensing and other computational problems. In this paper we present a "low-tech" scheme which, for any , allows to exhibit nearly Euclidean -dimensional subspaces of while using only random bits. Our results extend and complement (particularly) recent work by Guruswami-Lee-Wigderson.

	{'abstract': u'In categorified symplectic geometry, one studies the categorified algebraic and geometric structures that naturally arise on manifolds equipped with a closed nondegenerate (n+1)-form. The case relevant to classical string theory is when n=2 and is called "2-plectic geometry". Just as the Poisson bracket makes the smooth functions on a symplectic manifold into a Lie algebra, there is a Lie 2-algebra of observables associated to any 2-plectic manifold. String theory, closed 3-forms and Lie 2-algebras also play important roles in the theory of Courant algebroids. Courant algebroids are vector bundles which generalize the structures found in tangent bundles and quadratic Lie algebras. It is known that a particular kind of Courant algebroid (called an exact Courant algebroid) naturally arises in string theory, and that such an algebroid is classified up to isomorphism by a closed 3-form on the base space, which then induces a Lie 2-algebra structure on the space of global sections. In this paper we begin to establish precise connections between 2-plectic manifolds and Courant algebroids. We prove that any manifold M equipped with a 2-plectic form omega gives an exact Courant algebroid E_omega over M with Severa class [omega], and we construct an embedding of the Lie 2-algebra of observables into the Lie 2-algebra of sections of E_omega. We then show that this embedding identifies the observables as particular infinitesimal symmetries of E_omega which preserve the 2-plectic structure on M.',

Thus, C^ infty(X) actually has a far richer structure than the obvious R-algebra structure. We develop a version of algebraic geometry in which rings or algebras are replaced by C-infinity rings. As schemes are the basic objects in algebraic geometry, the new basic objects are "C-infinity schemes", a category of geometric objects which generalize smooth manifolds, and whose morphisms generalize smooth maps. We also study quasicoherent and coherent sheaves on C-infinity schemes, and "C-infinity stacks", in particular Deligne-Mumford C-infinity stacks, a 2-category of geometric objects generalizing orbifolds. This enables us to use the tools of algebraic geometry in differential geometry, and to describe singular spaces such as moduli spaces occurring in differential geometric problems. This paper forms the foundations of the author\'s new theory of "derived differential geometry", surveyed in arXiv:1206.4207 and in more detail in arXiv:1208.4948, which studies "d-manifolds" and "d-orbifolds", derived versions of smooth manifolds and smooth orbifolds. Derived differential geometry has applications to areas of symplectic geometry involving moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves. Many of these ideas are not new: C-infinity rings and C-infinity schemes have long been part of synthetic differential geometry. But we develop them in new directions. This paper is surveyed in arXiv:1104.4951.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the internal structure of a non-Abelian vortex in color superconductivity with respect to quark degrees of freedom. Stable non-Abelian vortices appear in the Color-Flavor-Locked phase whose symmetry SU(3)_ is further broken to SU(2)_ x U(1)_ at the vortex cores. Microscopic structure of vortices at scales shorter than the coherence length can be analyzed by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (B-dG) equation (rather than the Ginzburg-Landau equation). We obtain quark spectra from the B-dG equation by treating the diquark gap having the vortex configuration as a background field. We find that there are massless modes (zero modes) well-localized around a vortex, in the triplet and singlet states of the unbroken symmetry SU(2)_ x U(1)_. The velocities v_i of the massless modes (i=t,s for triplet and singlet) change at finite chemical potential mu, and decrease as mu becomes large. Therefore, low energy excitations in the vicinity of the vortices are effectively described by 1+1 dimensional massless fermions whose velocities are reduced v_i&lt;1.',

	{'abstract': u'Models for noncoherent error control in random linear network coding (RLNC) and store and forward (SAF) have been recently proposed. In this paper, we model different types of random network communications as the transmission of flats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us to introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding (RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously proposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we first evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in the error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and throughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of partial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC outperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more efficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible alterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which generalizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus reduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct metrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of codes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in particular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on rank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The gain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of complexity.',

In this work we show that when a three dimensional geometry admits a Killing vector field then the Ricci tensor of the geometry is determined in terms of the Killing vector field and its scalars. In this way we can generate all products and covariant derivatives at any order of the ricci tensor. Using this property we give ways of solving the field equations of Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) and New Massive Gravity (NMG) introduced recently. In particular when the scalars of the Killing vector field (timelike, spacelike and null cases) are constants then all three dimensional symmetric tensors of the geometry, the ricci and einstein tensors, their covariant derivatives at all orders, their products of all orders are completely determined by the Killing vector field and the metric. Hence the corresponding three dimensional metrics are strong candidates of solving all higher derivative gravitational field equations in three dimensions.',

Here, based on Bayes theorem, we propose a more direct method in which a posterior likelihood function is used both to construct the steered dynamics and to infer the contribution to equilibrium of all the sampled states. The method is implemented with two steering schedules. First, using non-autonomous steering, we calculate the migration barrier of the vacancy in Fe-alpha. Second, using an autonomous scheduling related to metadynamics and equivalent to temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics, we accurately reconstruct the two-dimensional free energy landscape of the 38-atom Lennard-Jones cluster as a function of an orientational bond-order parameter and energy, down to the solid-solid structural transition temperature of the cluster and without maximum-likelihood post-processing.',

	{'abstract': u"In 1979 Louis Witten demonstrated that stationary axially symmetric Einstein field equations and those for static axially symmetric self-dual SU(2) gauge fields can both be reduced to the same (Ernst) equation. In this paper we use this result as point of departure to prove the existence of the mass gap for quantum source-free Yang-Mills (Y-M) fields. The proof is facilitated by results of our recently published paper, JGP 59 (2009) 600-619. Since both pure gravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially symmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum descriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is successfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin and Nicolai, Nucl.Phys.B475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum gravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S) -type models are obtained. We found that the F-S-like model is best suited for description of electroweak interactions while strong interactions require extension of Witten's results to the SU(3) gauge group. Such an extension is nontrivial. It is linked with the symmetry group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) of the Standard Model. This result is quite rigid and should be taken into account in development of all grand unified theories. Also, the alternative (to the F-S-like) model emerges as by-product of such an extension. Both models are related to each other via known symmetry transformation. Both models possess gap in their excitation spectrum and are capable of producing knotted/linked configurations of gauge/gravity fields. In addition, the paper discusses relevance of the obtained results to heterotic strings and to scattering processes involving topology change. It ends with discussion about usefulness of this information for searches of Higgs boson.",

	{'abstract': u'The question of whether there is a logic that captures polynomial time was formulated by Yuri Gurevich in 1988. It is still wide open and regarded as one of the main open problems in finite model theory and database theory. Partial results have been obtained for specific classes of structures. In particular, it is known that fixed-point logic with counting captures polynomial time on all classes of graphs with excluded minors. The introductory part of this paper is a short survey of the state-of-the-art in the quest for a logic capturing polynomial time. The main part of the paper is concerned with classes of graphs defined by excluding induced subgraphs. Two of the most fundamental such classes are the class of chordal graphs and the class of line graphs. We prove that capturing polynomial time on either of these classes is as hard as capturing it on the class of all graphs. In particular, this implies that fixed-point logic with counting does not capture polynomial time on these classes. Then we prove that fixed-point logic with counting does capture polynomial time on the class of all graphs that are both chordal and line graphs.',

	{'abstract': u"Neurons perform computations, and convey the results of those computations through the statistical structure of their output spike trains. Here we present a practical method, grounded in the information-theoretic analysis of prediction, for inferring a minimal representation of that structure and for characterizing its complexity. Starting from spike trains, our approach finds their causal state models (CSMs), the minimal hidden Markov models or stochastic automata capable of generating statistically identical time series. We then use these CSMs to objectively quantify both the generalizable structure and the idiosyncratic randomness of the spike train. Specifically, we show that the expected algorithmic information content (the information needed to describe the spike train exactly) can be split into three parts describing (1) the time-invariant structure (complexity) of the minimal spike-generating process, which describes the spike train statistically; (2) the randomness (internal entropy rate) of the minimal spike-generating process; and (3) a residual pure noise term not described by the minimal spike-generating process. We use CSMs to approximate each of these quantities. The CSMs are inferred nonparametrically from the data, making only mild regularity assumptions, via the causal state splitting reconstruction algorithm. The methods presented here complement more traditional spike train analyses by describing not only spiking probability and spike train entropy, but also the complexity of a spike train's structure. We demonstrate our approach using both simulated spike trains and experimental data recorded in rat barrel cortex during vibrissa stimulation.",

	{'abstract': u'Here we have studied first and second-order intertwining approach to generate isospectral partner potentials of position-dependent (effective) mass Schroedinger equation. The second-order intertwiner is constructed directly by taking it as second order linear differential operator with position depndent coefficients and the system of equations arising from the intertwining relationship is solved for the coefficients by taking an ansatz. A complete scheme for obtaining general solution is obtained which is valid for any arbitrary potential and mass function. The proposed technique allows us to generate isospectral potentials with the following spectral modifications: (i) to add new bound state(s), (ii) to remove bound state(s) and (iii) to leave the spectrum unaffected. To explain our findings with the help of an illustration, we have used point canonical transformation (PCT) to obtain the general solution of the position dependent mass Schrodinger equation corresponding to a potential and mass function. It is shown that our results are consistent with the formulation of type A N-fold supersymmetry [14,18] for the particular case N = 1 and N = 2 respectively.',

	{'abstract': u'New Completely Integrable (2+1)-System is studied. It is based on the so-called L-A-B-triples where L is a 2D Schrodinger Operator. This approach was invented by S.Manakov and B.Dubrovin, I.Krichever, S.Novikov(DKN) in the works published in 1976. A nonstandard reduction for the 2D Schrodinger Operator (completely different from the one found by S.Novikov and A.Veselov in 1984) compatible with time dynamics of the new Nonlinear System, is studied here. It can be naturally treated as a 2D extension of the famous Burgers System. The Algebro-Geometric (AG) Periodic Solutions here are very specific and unusual (for general and reduced cases). The reduced system is linearizable like Burgers. However, the general one (and probably the reduced one also) certainly lead in the stationary AG case to the nonstandard examples of algebraic curves in the full complex 2D manifold of Bloch-Floquet functions W for the periodic elliptic 2D operator H where . However, in the nontrivial case the operators are nonselfadjoint. A Conjecture is formulated that for the nontrivial selfadjoint elliptic 2D Schrodinger operators H with periodic coefficients The Whole 2D Complex Manifolds W cannot not contain any Zariski open part of algebraic curve except maybe one selected level found in 1976 by DKN. Version 2 contains new results. It also corrects some non-accurate claims; in particular, the non-reduced system is non-linearizable in any trivial sense. In version 3 a misprint in the formulation of Theorem 1 was corrected.',

	{'abstract': u'Starting from a standard noncommutative gauge theory and using the Seiberg-Witten map we propose a new version of a noncommutative gravity. We use consistent deformation theory starting from a free gauge action and gauging a killing symmetry of the background metric to construct a deformation of the gauge theory that we can relate with gravity. The result of this consistent deformation of the gauge theory is nonpolynomial in A_ mu. From here we can construct a version of noncommutative gravity that is simpler than previous attempts. Our proposal is consistent and is not plagued with the problems of other approaches like twist symmetries or gauging other groups.',

	{'abstract': u'We discuss the origin of the microscopic description of correlations in quantum many-particle systems obeying Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. For correlation operators that give the alternative description of the quantum state evolution of Bose and Fermi particles, we deduce the von Neumann hierarchy of nonlinear equations and construct the solution of its initial-value problem in the corresponding spaces of sequences of trace class operators. The links of constructed solution both with the solution of the quantum BBGKY hierarchy and with the nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy for marginal correlation operators are discussed. The solutions of the Cauchy problems of these hierarchies are constructed for initial data satisfying a chaos property.',

	{'abstract': u'Universal vector wave equations allowing for a unified description of anyons, and also of usual bosons and fermions in the plane are proposed. The existence of two essentially different types of anyons, based on unitary and also on non-unitary infinite-dimensional half-bounded representations of the (2+1)D Lorentz algebra is revealed. Those associated with non-unitary representations interpolate between bosons and fermions. The extended formulation of the theory includes the previously known Jackiw-Nair (JN) and Majorana-Dirac (MD) descriptions of anyons as particular cases, and allows us to compose bosons and fermions from entangled anyons. The theory admits a simple supersymmetric generalization, in which the JN and MD systems are unified in N=1 and N=2 supermultiplets. Two different non-relativistic limits of the theory are investigated. The usual one generalizes Levy-Leblond\'s spin 1/2 theory to arbitrary spin, as well as to anyons. The second, "Jackiw-Nair" limit (that corresponds to Inonu-Wigner contraction with both anyon spin and light velocity going to infinity), is generalized to boson/fermion fields and interpolating anyons. The resulting exotic Galilei symmetry is studied in both the non-supersymmetric and the supersymmetric cases.',

Phys. 50, 103518 (2009)] of the quantum integrability of the theory, which is based on construction of self-adjoint extensions, leading to a regularized quantum Hamiltonian for an arbitrary n-particle sector. Starting from general discontinuity properties of the functions used to construct the self-adjoint extensions, we derive the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations. We show that due to non-symmetric and singular kernel, the self-consistency implies that only negative chemical potential values are allowed, which leads to the conclusion that, unlike its su(2) counterpart, the su(1,1) LL theory at T=0 has no instabilities.',

The fermionic correlation functions are written as series in the running coupling constants, with finite coefficients that admit explicit bounds at all orders. The implementation of Ward Identities in the RG scheme implies that the effective charges tend to a line of fixed points. At small momenta, the quasi-particle weight tends to zero and the effective Fermi velocity tends to a finite value. These limits are approached with a power law behavior characterized by non-universal critical exponents.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider a stable open queuing network as a steady non-equilibrium system of interacting particles. The network is completely specified by its underlying graphical structure, type of interaction at each node, and the Markovian transition rates between nodes. For such systems, we ask the question ``What is the most likely way for large currents to accumulate over time in a network ?'', where time is large compared to the system correlation time scale. We identify two interesting regimes. In the first regime, in which the accumulation of currents over time exceeds the expected value by a small to moderate amount (moderate large deviation), we find that the large-deviation distribution of currents is universal (independent of the interaction details), and there is no long-time and averaged over time accumulation of particles (condensation) at any nodes. In the second regime, in which the accumulation of currents over time exceeds the expected value by a large amount (severe large deviation), we find that the large-deviation current distribution is sensitive to interaction details, and there is a long-time accumulation of particles (condensation) at some nodes. The transition between the two regimes can be described as a dynamical second order phase transition. We illustrate these ideas using the simple, yet non-trivial, example of a single node with feedback.",

	{'abstract': u'It is well known among phylogeneticists that adding an extra taxon (e.g. species) to a data set can alter the structure of the optimal phylogenetic tree in surprising ways. However, little is known about this "rogue taxon" effect. In this paper we characterize the behavior of balanced minimum evolution (BME) phylogenetics on data sets of this type using tools from polyhedral geometry. First we show that for any distance matrix there exist distances to a "rogue taxon" such that the BME-optimal tree for the data set with the new taxon does not contain any nontrivial splits (bipartitions) of the optimal tree for the original data. Second, we prove a theorem which restricts the topology of BME-optimal trees for data sets of this type, thus showing that a rogue taxon cannot have an arbitrary effect on the optimal tree. Third, we construct polyhedral cones computationally which give complete answers for BME rogue taxon behavior when our original data fits a tree on four, five, and six taxa. We use these cones to derive sufficient conditions for rogue taxon behavior for four taxa, and to understand the frequency of the rogue taxon effect via simulation.',

After a brief overview of three types of principles for any (parametric) statistical theory and the proof that these principles are mutually exclusive, the paper shows that two kinds of support measures are conceivable, an additive one and a maxitive one (based on maximization operators). Unfortunately, none of them is able to cope with the ignorance part of the statistical experiment and, in the meantime, with the partial information given through the structure of the data.

	{'abstract': u'Experimental evidences and theoretical motivations lead to consider the curved space-time relativity based on the de Sitter group or as an appealing substitute to the flat space-time Poincare relativity. Quantum elementary systems are then associated to unitary irreducible representations of that simple Lie group. At the lowest limit of the discrete series lies a remarkable family of scalar representations involving Krein structures and related undecomposable representation cohomology which deserves to be thoroughly studied in view of quantization of the corresponding carrier fields. The purpose of this note is to present the mathematical material needed to examine the problem and to indicate possible extensions of an exemplary case, namely the so-called de Sitterian massless minimally coupled field, i.e. a scalar field in de Sitter space-time which does not couple to the Ricci curvature.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we propose a general class of algorithms for optimizing an extensive variety of nonsmoothly penalized objective functions that satisfy certain regularity conditions. The proposed framework utilizes the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm as its core optimization engine. The resulting algorithms rely on iterated soft-thresholding, implemented componentwise, allowing for fast, stable updating that avoids the need for any high-dimensional matrix inversion. We establish a local convergence theory for this class of algorithms under weaker assumptions than previously considered in the statistical literature. We also demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of new acceleration methods, originally proposed for the EM algorithm, in this class of problems. Simulation results and a microarray data example are provided to demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities and versatility.",

	{'abstract': u'To asses stability against 1/f noise, the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) onboard the Planck mission will acquire data at a rate much higher than the data rate allowed by its telemetry bandwith of 35.5 kbps. The data are processed by an onboard pipeline, followed onground by a reversing step. This paper illustrates the LFI scientific onboard processing to fit the allowed datarate. This is a lossy process tuned by using a set of 5 parameters Naver, r1, r2, q, O for each of the 44 LFI detectors. The paper quantifies the level of distortion introduced by the onboard processing, EpsilonQ, as a function of these parameters. It describes the method of optimizing the onboard processing chain. The tuning procedure is based on a optimization algorithm applied to unprocessed and uncompressed raw data provided either by simulations, prelaunch tests or data taken from LFI operating in diagnostic mode. All the needed optimization steps are performed by an automated tool, OCA2, which ends with optimized parameters and produces a set of statistical indicators, among them the compression rate Cr and EpsilonQ. For Planck/LFI the requirements are Cr = 2.4 and EpsilonQ &lt;= 10% of the rms of the instrumental white noise. To speedup the process an analytical model is developed that is able to extract most of the relevant information on EpsilonQ and Cr as a function of the signal statistics and the processing parameters. This model will be of interest for the instrument data analysis. The method was applied during ground tests when the instrument was operating in conditions representative of flight. Optimized parameters were obtained and the performance has been verified, the required data rate of 35.5 Kbps has been achieved while keeping EpsilonQ at a level of 3.8% of white noise rms well within the requirements.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper deals with the Weyl equation which is the massless Dirac equation. We study the Weyl equation in the stationary setting, i.e. when the spinor field oscillates harmonically in time. We suggest a new geometric interpretation of the stationary Weyl equation, one which does not require the use of spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant differentiation. We think of our 3-dimensional space as an elastic continuum and assume that material points of this continuum can experience no displacements, only rotations. This framework is a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material points of the space continuum are described mathematically by attaching to each geometric point an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases called the coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we choose the coframe and a density. We choose a particular potential energy which is conformally invariant and then incorporate time into our action in the standard Newtonian way, by subtracting kinetic energy. The main result of our paper is the theorem stating that in the stationary setting our model is equivalent to a pair of Weyl equations. The crucial element of the proof is the observation that our Lagrangian admits a factorization.',

The purpose of this contribution is to show how physics axiomatization can be achieved guided by a new heuristic rule. This will open up new roads into constructing the ultimate theory of everything. Three physical principles will be identified from the heuristic rule and they in turn will generate uniqueness results of various technical strengths regarding space, time, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics, electroweak symmetry and the dimensionality of space-time. The hope is that the strong force and the Standard Model axiomatizations are not too far out. Quantum gravity and cosmology are harder problems and maybe new approaches are needed. However, complete physics axiomatization seems to be an achievable goal, no longer part of philosophical discussions, but subject to rigorous mathematical proofs.",

	{'abstract': u'The Skyrme model is a low-energy effective field theory for QCD, where the baryons emerge as soliton solutions. It is, however, not so easy within the standard Skyrme model to reproduce the almost exact linear growth of the nuclear masses with the baryon number (topological charge), due to the lack of Bogomolny solutions in this model, which has also hindered analytical progress. Here we identify a submodel within the Skyrme-type low energy effective action which does have a Bogomolny bound and exact Bogomolny solutions, and therefore, at least at the classical level, reproduces the nuclear masses by construction. Due to its high symmetry, this model qualitatively reproduces the main features of the liquid droplet model of nuclei. Finally, we discuss under which circumstances the proposed sextic term, which is of an essentially geometric and topological nature, can be expected to give a reasonable description of properties of nuclei.',

	{'abstract': u'Fusion research on magnetic confinement is confronted with a severe problem concerning the electron densities ne to be used in fusion devices. Indeed, high densities are mandatory for obtaining large efficiencies, whereas it is empirically found that catastrophic disruptive events occur for densities exceeding a maximal one n^M_e. On the other hand, despite the large theoretical work there is no widely accepted, first principles model for the density limit (see [1], abstract). Here, we propose a simple microscopic model of a magnetized plasma suited for a tokamak, for which the existence of a density limit is proven. This property turns out to be a general collective feature of electrodynamics of point charges, which is lost in the continuum approximation. The law we find is n^M_e = 1.74 1/(me c^2) B^2/ mu_0, (1), where mu_0 is the vacuum permeability, c the speed of light, me the electron mass, and B the magnetic field. As shown in Fig. 1, the theoretical limit (big circles) is in rather good agreement with the empirical data, actually a surprisingly good one for a model based on first principles, with no adjustable parameter.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a generalization of stochastic bandits where the set of arms, , is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the mean-payoff function is "locally Lipschitz" with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection policy, called HOO (hierarchical optimistic optimization), with improved regret bounds compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In particular, our results imply that if is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally continuous with a known smoothness degree, then the expected regret of HOO is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by , i.e., the rate of growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm when the dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has quadratic computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps and does not rely on the doubling trick. We also introduce a modified strategy, which relies on the doubling trick but runs in linearithmic time. Both results are improvements with respect to previous approaches.',

With an appropriate choice of basis and real structure, this Drinfel\'d double agrees with the 3d anti-de Sitter algebra. The deformation parameter eta is related to the cosmological constant, while z is identified with the inverse of the speed of light and defines the signature of the metric.

	{'abstract': u'The non-Gaussian quasi maximum likelihood estimator is frequently used in GARCH models with intension to improve the efficiency of the GARCH parameters. However, unless the quasi-likelihood happens to be the true one, non-Gaussian QMLE methods suffers inconsistency even if shape parameters in the quasi-likelihood are estimated. To correct this bias, we identify an unknown scale parameter that is critical to the consistent estimation of non-Gaussian QMLE, and propose a two-step non-Gaussian QMLE (2SNG-QMLE) for estimation of the scale parameter and GARCH parameters. This novel approach is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it has higher efficiency than the Gaussian QMLE, particularly when the innovation error has heavy tails. Two extensions are proposed to further improve the efficiency of 2SNG-QMLE. The impact of relative heaviness of tails of the innovation and quasi-likelihood distributions on the asymptotic efficiency has been thoroughly investigated. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical study confirm the advantages of the proposed approach.',

	{'abstract': u"Stochastic processes are proposed whose master equations coincide with classical wave, telegraph, and Klein-Gordon equations. Similar to predecessors based on the Goldstein-Kac telegraph process, the model describes the motion of particles with constant speed and transitions between discreet allowed velocity directions. A new ingredient is that transitions into a given velocity state depend on spatial derivatives of other states populations, rather than on populations themselves. This feature requires the sacrifice of the single-particle character of the model, but allows to imitate the Huygens' principle and to recover wave equations in arbitrary dimensions.",

	{'abstract': u'Mandatory emission trading schemes are being established around the world. Participants of such market schemes are always exposed to risks. This leads to the creation of an accompanying market for emission-linked derivatives. To evaluate the fair prices of such financial products, one needs appropriate models for the evolution of the underlying assets, emission allowance certificates. In this paper, we discuss continuous time diffusion and jump-diffusion models, the latter enabling one to model information shocks that cause jumps in allowance prices. We show that the resulting martingale dynamics can be described in terms of non-linear partial differential and integro-differential equations and use a finite difference method to investigate numerical properties of their discretizations. The results are illustrated by a small numerical study.',

	{'abstract': u'The long-time dynamics of reaction-diffusion processes in low dimensions is dominated by fluctuation effects. The one-dimensional coagulation-diffusion process describes the kinetics of particles which freely hop between the sites of a chain and where upon encounter of two particles, one of them disappears with probability one. The empty-interval method has, since a long time, been a convenient tool for the exact calculation of time-dependent particle densities in this model. We generalise the empty-interval method by considering the probability distributions of two simultaneous empty intervals at a given distance. While the equations of motion of these probabilities reduce for the coagulation-diffusion process to a simple diffusion equation in the continuum limit, consistency with the single-interval distribution introduces several non-trivial boundary conditions which are solved for the first time for arbitrary initial configurations. In this way, exact space-time-dependent correlation functions can be directly obtained and their dynamic scaling behaviour is analysed for large classes of initial conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'The asymptotic shape of randomly growing radial clusters is studied. We pose the problem in terms of the dynamics of stochastic partial differential equations. We concentrate on the properties of the realizations of the stochastic growth process and in particular on the interface fluctuations. Our goal is unveiling under which conditions the developing radial cluster asymptotically weakly converges to the concentrically propagating spherically symmetric profile or either to a symmetry breaking shape. We demonstrate that the long range correlations of the surface fluctuations obey a self-affine scaling and that scale invariance is achieved by means of the introduction of three critical exponents. These are able to characterize the large scale dynamics and to describe those regimes dominated by system size evolution. The connection of these results with mathematical morphogenetic problems is also outlined.',

The optimal problem is first formulated in terms of a system of Snell envelopes for the profit and cost yields which act as obstacles to each other. We then construct both a minimal and a maximal solutions using an approximation scheme of the associated system of reflected backward SDEs. When the dependence of the cash-flows on the sources of uncertainty, such as fluctuation market prices, assumed to evolve according to a diffusion process, is made explicit, we also obtain a connection between these solutions and viscosity solutions of a system of variational inequalities (VI) with interconnected obstacles.

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the geometric interpretation of quantized Nambu-Poisson structures in terms of noncommutative geometries. We describe an extension of the usual axioms of quantization in which classical Nambu-Poisson structures are translated to n-Lie algebras at quantum level. We demonstrate that this generalized procedure matches an extension of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization yielding quantized spheres, hyperboloids, and superspheres. The extended Berezin quantization of spheres is closely related to a deformation quantization of n-Lie algebras, as well as the approach based on harmonic analysis. We find an interpretation of Nambu-Heisenberg n-Lie algebras in terms of foliations of R^n by fuzzy spheres, fuzzy hyperboloids, and noncommutative hyperplanes. Some applications to the quantum geometry of branes in M-theory are also briefly discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'It is known that Heston\'s stochastic volatility model exhibits moment explosion, and that the critical moment can be obtained by solving (numerically) a simple equation. This yields a leading order expansion for the implied volatility at large strikes: (Roger Lee\'s moment formula). Motivated by recent "tail-wing" refinements of this moment formula, we first derive a novel tail expansion for the Heston density, sharpening previous work of Dragulescu and Yakovenko [Quant. Finance 2, 6 (2002), 443--453], and then show the validity of a refined expansion of the type , where all constants are explicitly known as functions of , the Heston model parameters, spot vol and maturity . In the case of the "zero-correlation" Heston model such an expansion was derived by Gulisashvili and Stein [Appl. Math. Optim. 61, 3 (2010), 287--315]. Our methods and results may prove useful beyond the Heston model: the entire quantitative analysis is based on affine principles: at no point do we need knowledge of the (explicit, but cumbersome) closed form expression of the Fourier transform of (equivalently: Mellin transform of ); what matters is that these transforms satisfy ordinary differential equations of Riccati type. Secondly, our analysis reveals a new parameter ("critical slope"), defined in a model free manner, which drives the second and higher order terms in tail- and implied volatility expansions.',

	{'abstract': u'While existing mathematical descriptions can accurately account for phenomena at microscopic scales (e.g. molecular dynamics), these are often high-dimensional, stochastic and their applicability over macroscopic time scales of physical interest is computationally infeasible or impractical. In complex systems, with limited physical insight on the coherent behavior of their constituents, the only available information is data obtained from simulations of the trajectories of huge numbers of degrees of freedom over microscopic time scales. This paper discusses a Bayesian approach to deriving probabilistic coarse-grained models that simultaneously address the problems of identifying appropriate reduced coordinates and the effective dynamics in this lower-dimensional representation. At the core of the models proposed lie simple, low-dimensional dynamical systems which serve as the building blocks of the global model. These approximate the latent, generating sources and parameterize the reduced-order dynamics. We discuss parallelizable, online inference and learning algorithms that employ Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and scale linearly with the dimensionality of the observed dynamics. We propose a Bayesian adaptive time-integration scheme that utilizes probabilistic predictive estimates and enables rigorous concurrent s imulation over macroscopic time scales. The data-driven perspective advocated assimilates computational and experimental data and thus can materialize data-model fusion. It can deal with applications that lack a mathematical description and where only observational data is available. Furthermore, it makes non-intrusive use of existing computational models.',

This class extends the regular dispersion models by letting the dispersion parameter vary throughout the observations, and contains the dispersion models as particular case. General formulae for the second-order bias are obtained explicitly in dispersion models with dispersion covariates, which generalize previous results by Botter and Cordeiro (1998), Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991), Cordeiro and Vasconcellos (1999), and Paula (1992). The practical use of the formulae is that we can derive closed-form expressions for the second-order biases of the maximum likelihood estimators of the regression and dispersion parameters when the information matrix has a closed-form. Various expressions for the second-order biases are given for special models. The formulae have advantages for numerical purposes because they require only a supplementary weighted linear regression. We also compare these bias-corrected estimators with two different estimators which are also bias-free to the second-order that are based on bootstrap methods. These estimators are compared by simulation.',

This construction is applied to the parameterisation of generalised coherent states, which is useful for practical calculations and provides an elementary combinatorial approach to the geometry of the coherent state space. The results are extended to Hilbert spaces with indefinite inner products, leading to the introduction of a new kind of generalised coherent states.',

	{'abstract': u"Coding theorems in quantum Shannon theory express the ultimate rates at which a sender can transmit information over a noisy quantum channel. More often than not, the known formulas expressing these transmission rates are intractable, requiring an optimization over an infinite number of uses of the channel. Researchers have rarely found quantum channels with a tractable classical or quantum capacity, but when such a finding occurs, it demonstrates a complete understanding of that channel's capabilities for transmitting classical or quantum information. Here, we show that the three-dimensional capacity region for entanglement-assisted transmission of classical and quantum information is tractable for the Hadamard class of channels. Examples of Hadamard channels include generalized dephasing channels, cloning channels, and the Unruh channel. The generalized dephasing channels and the cloning channels are natural processes that occur in quantum systems through the loss of quantum coherence or stimulated emission, respectively. The Unruh channel is a noisy process that occurs in relativistic quantum information theory as a result of the Unruh effect and bears a strong relationship to the cloning channels. We give exact formulas for the entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communication capacity regions of these channels. The coding strategy for each of these examples is superior to a naive time-sharing strategy, and we introduce a measure to determine this improvement.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider the two major computational effects of states and exceptions, from the point of view of diagrammatic logics. We get a surprising result: there exists a symmetry between these two effects, based on the well-known categorical duality between products and coproducts. More precisely, the lookup and update operations for states are respectively dual to the throw and catch operations for exceptions. This symmetry is deeply hidden in the programming languages; in order to unveil it, we start from the monoidal equational logic and we add progressively the logical features which are necessary for dealing with either effect. This approach gives rise to a new point of view on states and exceptions, which bypasses the problems due to the non-algebraicity of handling exceptions.',

This study of doubly-periodic potentials is a natural sequel to earlier work on complex classical trajectories in trigonometric potentials. For elliptic potentials there is a two-dimensional array of identical cells in the complex plane, and each cell contains a pair of turning points. The particle can travel both horizontally and vertically as it visits these cells, and sometimes the particle is captured temporarily by a pair of turning points. If the particle's energy lies in a conduction band, the particle drifts through the lattice of cells and is never captured by the same pair of turning points more than once.

	{'abstract': u'Non-adaptive group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of items into different pools. Each pool is then tested and defective items are identified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools required to identify at most defective items. Motivated by applications in network tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of group testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group testing problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a graph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any set of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated with a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to the special case of a complete graph on vertices. For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained, namely, that the number of tests required to identify defective items is substantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing problems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if T(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph , it is shown that with non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective items. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph , as well as expander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify defective items. Next, a specific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it is shown that non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify defective items. Noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing problem are considered, for which parallel results are developed. We also briefly discuss extensions to compressive sensing on graphs.',

We consider a prototype for a higher-order spectral clustering method based on the residual from a local linear approximation. We obtain theoretical guarantees for this algorithm and show that, in terms of both separation and robustness to outliers, it outperforms the standard spectral clustering algorithm (based on pairwise distances) of Ng, Jordan and Weiss (NIPS '01). The optimal choice for some of the tuning parameters depends on the dimension and thickness of the clusters. We provide estimators that come close enough for our theoretical purposes. We also discuss the cases of clusters of mixed dimensions and of clusters that are generated from smoother surfaces.

	{'abstract': u'In three spatial dimensions, in the unitary limit of a non-relativistic quantum Bose or Fermi gas, the scattering length diverges. This occurs at a renormalization group fixed point, thus these systems present interesting examples of interacting scale-invariant models with dynamical exponent z=2. We study this problem in two and three spatial dimensions using the S-matrix based approach to the thermodynamics we recently developed. It is well suited to the unitary limit where the S-matrix equals -1, since it allows an expansion in the inverse coupling. We define a meaningful scale-invariant, unitary limit in two spatial dimensions, where again the scattering length diverges. In the two-dimensional case, the integral equation for the pseudo-energy becomes transcendentally algebraic, and we can easily compute the various universal scaling functions as a function of mu/T, such as the energy per particle. The ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density is above the conjectured lower bound of for all cases except attractive bosons. For attractive 2-component fermions, the ratio is greater than 6.07 times the conjectured lower bound, whereas for attractive bosons it is greater than 0.4 times it.',

	{'abstract': u"The paper shows deep connections between exotic smoothings of small R^4, noncommutative algebras of foliations and quantization. At first, based on the close relation of foliations and noncommutative C*-algebras we show that cyclic cohomology invariants characterize some small exotic R^4. Certain exotic smooth R^4's define a generalized embedding into a space which is K-theoretic equivalent to a noncommutative Banach algebra. Furthermore, we show that a factor III von Neumann algebra is naturally related with nonstandard smoothing of a small R^4 and conjecture that this factor is the unique hyperfinite factor III_1. We also show how an exotic smoothing of a small R^4 is related to the Drinfeld-Turaev (deformation) quantization of the Poisson algebra (X(S,SL(2,C),) of complex functions on the space of flat connections X(S,SL(2,C) over a surface S, and that the result of this quantization is the skein algebra (K_t(S),[,]) for the deformation parameter t=exp(h/4). This skein algebra is retrieved as a II_1 factor of horocycle flows which is Morita equivalent to the II_infty factor von Neumann algebra which in turn determines the unique factor III_1 as crossed product. Moreover, the structure of Casson handles determine the factor II_1 algebra too. Thus, the quantization of the Poisson algebra of closed circles in a leaf of the codimension 1 foliation of S^3 gives rise to the factor III_1 associated with exotic smoothness of R^4. Finally, the approach to quantization via exotic 4-smoothness is considered as a fundamental question in dimension 4 and compared with the topos approach to quantum theories.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we shall discuss the backreaction of a massive quantum scalar field on the curvature, the latter treated as a classical field. Furthermore, we shall deal with this problem in the realm of cosmological spacetimes by analyzing the Einstein equations in a semiclassical fashion. More precisely, we shall show that, at least on small intervals of time, solutions for this interacting system exist. This result will be achieved providing an iteration scheme and showing that the series, obtained starting from the massless solution, converges in the appropriate Banach space. The quantum states with good ultraviolet behavior (Hadamard property), used in order to obtain the backreaction, will be completely determined by their form on the initial surface if chosen to be lightlike. Furthermore, on small intervals of time, they do not influence the behavior of the exact solution. On large intervals of time the situation is more complicated but, if the spacetime is expanding, we shall show that the end-point of the evolution does not depend strongly on the quantum state, because, in this limit, the expectation values of the matter fields responsible for the backreaction do not depend on the particular homogeneous Hadamard state at all. Finally, we shall comment on the interpretation of the semiclassical Einstein equations for this kind of problems. Although the fluctuations of the expectation values of pointlike fields diverge, if the spacetime and the quantum state have a large spatial symmetry and if we consider the smeared fields on regions of large spatial volume, they tend to vanish. Assuming this point of view the semiclassical Einstein equations become more reliable.',

	{'abstract': u"In the framework of the algebraic formulation, we discuss and analyse some new features of the local structure of a real scalar quantum field theory in a strongly causal spacetime. In particular we use the properties of the exponential map to set up a local version of a bulk-to-boundary correspondence. The bulk is a suitable subset of a geodesic neighbourhood of any but fixed point p of the underlying background, while the boundary is a part of the future light cone having p as its own tip. In this regime, we provide a novel notion for the extended *-algebra of Wick polynomials on the said cone and, on the one hand, we prove that it contains the information of the bulk counterpart via an injective *-homomorphism while, on the other hand, we associate to it a distinguished state whose pull-back in the bulk is of Hadamard form. The main advantage of this point of view arises if one uses the universal properties of the exponential map and of the light cone in order to show that, for any two given backgrounds M and M' and for any two subsets of geodesic neighbourhoods of two arbitrary points, it is possible to engineer the above procedure such that the boundary extended algebras are related via a restriction homomorphism. This allows for the pull-back of boundary states in both spacetimes and, thus, to set up a machinery which permits the comparison of expectation values of local field observables in M and M'.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider the problem of testing whether two finite groups are isomorphic. Whereas the case where both groups are abelian is well understood and can be solved efficiently, very little is known about the complexity of isomorphism testing for nonabelian groups. Le Gall has constructed an efficient classical algorithm for a class of groups corresponding to one of the most natural ways of constructing nonabelian groups from abelian groups: the groups that are extensions of an abelian group by a cyclic group with the order of coprime with . More precisely, the running time of that algorithm is almost linear in the order of the input groups. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm solving the same problem in time polynomial in the logarithm of the order of the input groups. This algorithm works in the black-box setting and is the first quantum algorithm solving instances of the nonabelian group isomorphism problem exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithms.',

Our results apply to quantum spin Hamiltonians that can be written as a sum of geometrically local commuting projectors on a D-dimensional lattice with certain topological order conditions. Given such a Hamiltonian H_0 we prove that there exists a constant threshold epsilon&gt;0 such that for any perturbation V representable as a sum of short-range bounded-norm interactions the perturbed Hamiltonian H=H_0+ epsilon V has well-defined spectral bands originating from O(1) smallest eigenvalues of H_0. These bands are separated from the rest of the spectrum and from each other by a constant gap. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue of H_0 has exponentially small width (as a function of the lattice size). Our proof exploits a discrete version of Hamiltonian flow equations, the theory of relatively bounded operators, and the Lieb-Robinson bound.',

	{'abstract': u'A BV algebra is a formal framework within which the BV quantization algorithm is implemented. In addition to the gauge symmetry, encoded in the BV master equation, the master action often exhibits further global symmetries, which may be in turn gauged. We show how to carry this out in a BV algebraic set up. Depending on the nature of the global symmetry, the gauging involves coupling to a pure ghost system with a varying amount of ghostly supersymmetry. Coupling to an N=0 ghost system yields an ordinary gauge theory whose observables are appropriately classified by the invariant BV cohomology. Coupling to an N=1 ghost system leads to a topological gauge field theory whose observables are classified by the equivariant BV cohomology. Coupling to higher ghost systems yields topological gauge field theories with higher topological symmetry. In the latter case, however, problems of a completely new kind emerge, which call for a revision of the standard BV algebraic framework.',

	{'abstract': u'Examples of symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC-POVMs) have been constructed in every dimension less than or equal to 67. However, it remains an open question whether they exist in all finite dimensions. A SIC-POVM is usually thought of as a highly symmetric structure in quantum state space. However, its elements can equally well be regarded as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(d,C). In this paper we examine the resulting structure constants, which are calculated from the traces of the triple products of the SIC-POVM elements and which, it turns out, characterize the SIC-POVM up to unitary equivalence. We show that the structure constants have numerous remarkable properties. In particular we show that the existence of a SIC-POVM in dimension d is equivalent to the existence of a certain structure in the adjoint representation of gl(d,C). We hope that transforming the problem in this way, from a question about quantum state space to a question about Lie algebras, may help to make the existence problem tractable.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we consider band-structure calculations governed by the Helmholtz or Maxwell equations in piecewise homogeneous periodic materials. Methods based on boundary integral equations are natural in this context, since they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in complicated geometries. In order to handle the quasi-periodic conditions which are imposed on the unit cell, the free-space Green's function is typically replaced by its quasi-periodic cousin. Unfortunately, the quasi-periodic Green's function diverges for families of parameter values that correspond to resonances of the empty unit cell. Here, we bypass this problem by means of a new integral representation that relies on the free-space Green's function alone, adding auxiliary layer potentials on the boundary of the unit cell itself. An important aspect of our method is that by carefully including a few neighboring images, the densities may be kept smooth and convergence rapid. This framework results in an integral equation of the second kind, avoids spurious resonances, and achieves spectral accuracy. Because of our image structure, inclusions which intersect the unit cell walls may be handled easily and automatically. Our approach is compatible with fast-multipole acceleration, generalizes easily to three dimensions, and avoids the complication of divergent lattice sums.",

	{'abstract': u'Higher Auslander algebras were introduced by Iyama generalizing classical concepts from representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. Recently these higher analogues of classical representation theory have been increasingly studied. Cyclic polytopes are classical objects of study in convex geometry. In particular, their triangulations have been studied with a view towards generalizing the rich combinatorial structure of triangulations of polygons. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between these two seemingly unrelated subjects. We study triangulations of even-dimensional cyclic polytopes and tilting modules for higher Auslander algebras of linearly oriented type A which are summands of the cluster tilting module. We show that such tilting modules correspond bijectively to triangulations. Moreover mutations of tilting modules correspond to bistellar flips of triangulations. For any d-representation finite algebra we introduce a certain d-dimensional cluster category and study its cluster tilting objects. For higher Auslander algebras of linearly oriented type A we obtain a similar correspondence between cluster tilting objects and triangulations of a certain cyclic polytope. Finally we study certain functions on generalized laminations in cyclic polytopes, and show that they satisfy analogues of tropical cluster exchange relations. Moreover we observe that the terms of these exchange relations are closely related to the terms occuring in the mutation of cluster tilting objects.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper takes a new look at ideals generated by 2x2 minors of 2x3 matrices whose entries are powers of three elements not necessarily forming a regular sequence. A special case of this are the ideals determining monomial curves in three dimensional space, which were already studied by Herzog. In the broader context studied here, these ideals are identified as Northcott ideals in the sense of Vasconcelos, and so their liaison properties are displayed. It is shown that they are set-theoretically complete intersections, revisiting the work of Bresinsky and of Valla. Even when the three elements are taken to be variables in a polynomial ring in three variables over a field, this point of view gives a larger class of ideals than just the defining ideals of monomial curves. We then characterize when the ideals in this larger class are prime, we show that they are usually radical and, using the theory of multiplicities, we give upper bounds on the number of their minimal prime ideals, one of these primes being a uniquely determined prime ideal of definition of a monomial curve. Finally, we provide examples of characteristic-dependent minimal prime and primary structures for these ideals.',

	{'abstract': u'The aim of the article to clarify the status of Shapiro plane wave solutions of the Schr "odinger\'s equation in the frames of the well-known general method of separation of variables. To solve this task, we use the well-known cylindrical coordinates in Riemann and Lobachevsky spaces, naturally related with Euler angle-parameters. Conclusion may be drawn: the general method of separation of variables embraces the all plane wave solutions; the plane waves in Lobachevsky and Riemann space consist of a small part of the whole set of basis wave functions of Schr "odinger equation. In space of constant positive curvature , a complex analog of horospherical coordinates of Lobachevsky space is introduced. To parameterize real space , two complex coordinates must obey additional restriction in the form of the equation . The metrical tensor of space is expressed in terms of with additional constraint, or through pairs of conjugate variables or ; correspondingly exist three different representations for Schr "dinger Hamiltonian. Shapiro plane waves are determined and explored as solutions of Schr "odinger equation in complex horosperical coordinates of . In particular, two oppositely directed plane waves may be presented as exponentials in conjugated coordinates. and .

	{'abstract': u'It is known that the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system (M-K-G), when written relative to the Coulomb gauge, is globally well-posed for finite-energy initial data. This result, due to Klainerman and Machedon, relies crucially on the null structure of the main bilinear terms of M-K-G in Coulomb gauge. It appears to have been believed that such a structure is not present in Lorenz gauge, but we prove here that it is, and we use this fact to prove finite-energy global well-posedness in Lorenz gauge. The latter has the advantage, compared to Coulomb gauge, of being Lorentz invariant, hence M-K-G in Lorenz gauge is a system of nonlinear wave equations, whereas in Coulomb gauge the system has a less symmetric form, as it contains also a nonlinear elliptic equation.',

	{'abstract': u'The wave-Sobolev spaces are -based Sobolev spaces on the Minkowski space-time , with Fourier weights are adapted to the symbol of the d\'Alembertian. They are a standard tool in the study of regularity properties of nonlinear wave equations, and in such applications the need arises for product estimates in these spaces. Unfortunately, it seems that with every new application some estimates come up which have not yet appeared in the literature, and then one has to resort to a set of well-established procedures for proving the missing estimates. To relieve the tedium of having to constantly fill in such gaps "by hand", we make here a systematic effort to determine the complete set of estimates in the bilinear case. We determine a set of necessary conditions for a product estimate to hold. These conditions define a polyhedron in the space of exponents . We then show, in space dimension , that all points in the interior of , and all points on the faces minus the edges, give product estimates. We can also allow some but not all points on the edges, but here we do not claim to have the sharp result. The corresponding result for and will be published elsewhere.',

In particular: the stable framed mapping class group has trivial rational homology, and its abelianisation is Z/24; the rational homology of the stable Pin mapping class groups coincides with that of the non-orientable mapping class group, and their abelianisations are Z/2 for Pin^+ and (Z/2)^3 for Pin^-.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a new detection algorithm for MIMO communication systems employing high order QAM constellations. The factor graph that corresponds to this problem is very loopy; in fact, it is a complete graph. Hence, a straightforward application of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm yields very poor results. Our algorithm is based on an optimal tree approximation of the Gaussian density of the unconstrained linear system. The finite-set constraint is then applied to obtain a loop-free discrete distribution. It is shown that even though the approximation is not directly applied to the exact discrete distribution, applying the BP algorithm to the loop-free factor graph outperforms current methods in terms of both performance and complexity. The improved performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of MIMO detection.',

In one-dimension, the KPZ class has the dynamical scaling exponent , that means one should find a universal space-time limiting process under the scaling of time as , space like and fluctuations like as . In this paper we provide evidence for this belief. We prove that under certain hypotheses, growth models display temporal slow decorrelation. That is to say that in the scalings above, the limiting spatial process for times and are identical, for any . The hypotheses are known to be satisfied for certain last passage percolation models, the polynuclear growth model, and the totally / partially asymmetric simple exclusion process. Using slow decorrelation we may extend known fluctuation limit results to space-time regions where correlation functions are unknown. The approach we develop requires the minimal expected hypotheses for slow decorrelation to hold and provides a simple and intuitive proof which applied to a wide variety of models.',

	{'abstract': u'To understand the network response to large-scale physical attacks, we investigate the asymptotic capacity of a half-duplex fading relay network with random node failures when the number of relays is infinitely large. In this paper, a simplified independent attack model is assumed where each relay node fails with a certain probability. The noncoherent relaying scheme is considered, which corresponds to the case of zero forward-link channel state information (CSI) at the relays. Accordingly, the whole relay network can be shown equivalent to a Rayleigh fading channel, where we derive the -outage capacity upper bound according to the multiple access (MAC) cut-set, and the -outage achievable rates for both the amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) strategies. Furthermore, we show that the DF strategy is asymptotically optimal as the outage probability goes to zero, with the AF strategy strictly suboptimal over all signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Regarding the rate loss due to random attacks, the AF strategy suffers a less portion of rate loss than the DF strategy in the high SNR regime, while the DF strategy demonstrates more robust performance in the low SNR regime.',

There is a Kitai-like criterion that implies subspace-hypercyclicity and although the spectrum of a subspace-hypercyclic operator must intersect the unit circle, not every component of the spectrum will do so.

	{'abstract': u"Oseledets' celebrated Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) is concerned with the exponential growth rates of vectors under the action of a linear cocycle on R^d. When the linear actions are invertible, the MET guarantees an almost-everywhere pointwise splitting of R^d into subspaces of distinct exponential growth rates (called Lyapunov exponents). When the linear actions are non-invertible, Oseledets' MET only yields the existence of a filtration of subspaces, the elements of which contain all vectors that grow no faster than exponential rates given by the Lyapunov exponents. The authors recently demonstrated that a splitting over R^d is guaranteed even without the invertibility assumption on the linear actions. Motivated by applications of the MET to cocycles of (non-invertible) transfer operators arising from random dynamical systems, we demonstrate the existence of an Oseledets splitting for cocycles of quasi-compact non-invertible linear operators on Banach spaces.",

A sequential adaptive sampling-and-refinement procedure called Distilled Sensing (DS) is proposed and analyzed. DS is a form of multi-stage experimental design and testing. Because of the adaptive nature of the data collection, DS can detect and localize far weaker signals than possible from non-adaptive measurements. In particular, reliable detection and localization (support estimation) using non-adaptive samples is possible only if the signal amplitudes grow logarithmically with the problem dimension. Here it is shown that using adaptive sampling, reliable detection is possible provided the amplitude exceeds a constant, and localization is possible when the amplitude exceeds any arbitrarily slowly growing function of the dimension.',

	{'abstract': u'This is an expository article. It discusses an approach to hypoelliptic Fredholm index theory based on noncommutative methods (groupoids, C*-algebras, K-theory). The paper starts with an explicit index theorem for scalar second order differential operators on 3-manifolds that are Fredholm but not elliptic. This low-brow index formula is expressed in terms of winding numbers. We then proceed to show how this theorem is a special case of a much more general index theorem for subelliptic operators on contact manifolds. Finally we discuss the noncommutative topology that is employed in the proof of this theorem. We present these results as an instance in which noncommutative topology is fruitful in proving a very explicit (analytic/geometric) classical result.',

First we find a geometric property of a link diagram, which is less than or equal to the twist number, that bounds the Mahler measure of the Kauffman bracket.

	{'abstract': u'This paper is concerned with the values of Harish-Chandra characters of a class of positive-depth, toral, very supercuspidal representations of -adic symplectic and special orthogonal groups, near the identity element. We declare two representations equivalent if their characters coincide on a specific neighbourhood of the identity (which is larger than the neighbourhood on which Harish-Chandra local character expansion holds). We construct a parameter space (that depends on the group and a real number ) for the set of equivalence classes of the representations of minimal depth satisfying some additional assumptions. This parameter space is essentially a geometric object defined over . Given a non-Archimedean local field with sufficiently large residual characteristic, the part of the character table near the identity element for that comes from our class of representations is parameterized by the residue-field points of . The character values themselves can be recovered by specialization from a constructible motivic exponential function. The values of such functions are algorithmically computable. It is in this sense that we show that a large part of the character table of the group is computable.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a possible definition of a mobility gap for a many-body quantum system, in analogy to definitions of dynamical localization for single particle systems. Using this definition, we construct "corrected" quasi-adiabatic continuation operators. Under an appropriate definition of a unique ground state, we show how to introduce virtual fluxes. Armed with these results, we can directly carry over previous results in the case of a spectral gap. We present a proof of decay of correlation functions and we present a proof of Hall conductance quantization under very mild density-of-states assumptions defined later. We also generalize these definitions to the case of a "bulk mobility gap", in the case of a system with boundaries, and present a proof of Hall conductance quantization on an annulus under appropriate assumptions. Further, we present a new "optimized" quasi-adiabatic continuation operator which simplifies previous estimates and tightens bounds in certain cases. This is presented in an appendix which can be read independently of the rest of the paper as it also improves estimates in the case of systems with a spectral gap. This filter function used decays in time at least as fast as for all , a class of decay called subexponential (a tighter description of what is possible is below). Using this function it is possible to tighten recent estimates of the Hall conductance quantization for gapped systems cite to a decay which is subexponential in system size.',

	{'abstract': u'Generalized Fourier transformation between the position and the momentum representation of a quantum state is constructed in a coordinate independent way. The only ingredient of this construction is the symplectic (canonical) geometry of the phase-space: no linear structure is necessary. It is shown that the "fractional Fourier transform" provides a simple example of this construction. As an application of this techniques we show that for any linear Hamiltonian system, its quantum dynamics can be obtained exactly as the lift of the corresponding classical dynamics by means of the above transformation. Moreover, it can be deduced from the free quantum evolution. This way new, unknown symmetries of the Schr "odinger equation can be constructed. It is also argued that the above construction defines in a natural way a connection in the bundle of quantum states, with the base space describing all their possible representations. The non-flatness of this connection would be responsible for the non-existence of a quantum representation of the complete algebra of classical observables.',

	{'abstract': u'The derivation of statistical properties for Partial Least Squares regression can be a challenging task. The reason is that the construction of latent components from the predictor variables also depends on the response variable. While this typically leads to good performance and interpretable models in practice, it makes the statistical analysis more involved. In this work, we study the intrinsic complexity of Partial Least Squares Regression. Our contribution is an unbiased estimate of its Degrees of Freedom. It is defined as the trace of the first derivative of the fitted values, seen as a function of the response. We establish two equivalent representations that rely on the close connection of Partial Least Squares to matrix decompositions and Krylov subspace techniques. We show that the Degrees of Freedom depend on the collinearity of the predictor variables: The lower the collinearity is, the higher the Degrees of Freedom are. In particular, they are typically higher than the naive approach that defines the Degrees of Freedom as the number of components. Further, we illustrate how the Degrees of Freedom approach can be used for the comparison of different regression methods. In the experimental section, we show that our Degrees of Freedom estimate in combination with information criteria is useful for model selection.',

	{'abstract': u'The purpose of this paper is to describe the numerical solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) for an optimal control problem for quantum spin systems. This HJB equation is a first order nonlinear partial differential equation defined on a Lie group. We employ recent extensions of the theory of viscosity solutions from Euclidean space to Riemannian manifolds to interpret possibly non-differentiable solutions to this equation. Results from differential topology on the triangulation of manifolds are then used to develop a finite difference approximation method, which is shown to converge using viscosity solution techniques. An example is provided to illustrate the method.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper analyzes the behavior of quantum channels, particularly in large dimensions, by proving various properties of the quantum gate fidelity. Many of these properties are of independent interest in the theory of distance measures on quantum operations. A non-uniqueness result for the gate fidelity is proven, a consequence of which is the existence of non-depolarizing channels that produce a constant gate fidelity on pure states. Asymptotically, the gate fidelity associated with any quantum channel is shown to converge to that of a depolarizing channel. Methods for estimating the minimum of the gate fidelity are also presented.',

The variational-iteration method given by He is used to solve the derived time fractional KdV equation. The calculations of the solution with initial condition A0*sech(cx)^2 are carried out.

	{'abstract': u'First, we define a generalization of the standard quantum Toda chain inspired by a construction of quantum cohomology of partial flags spaces GL( ell+1)/P, P a parabolic subgroup. Common eigenfunctions of the parabolic quantum Toda chains are generalized Whittaker functions given by matrix elements of infinite-dimensional representations of gl( ell+1). For maximal parabolic subgroups (i.e. for P such that GL( ell+1)/P= mathbb^) we construct two different representations of the corresponding parabolic Whittaker functions as correlation functions in topological quantum field theories on a two-dimensional disk. In one case the parabolic Whittaker function is given by a correlation function in a type A equivariant topological sigma model with the target space mathbb^. In the other case the same Whittaker function appears as a correlation function in a type B equivariant topological Landau-Ginzburg model related with the type A model by mirror symmetry. This note is a continuation of our project of establishing a relation between two-dimensional topological field theories (and more generally topological string theories) and Archimedean ( infty-adic) geometry. From this perspective the existence of two, mirror dual, topological field theory representations of the parabolic Whittaker functions provide a quantum field theory realization of the local Archimedean Langlands duality for Whittaker functions. The established relation between the Archimedean Langlands duality and mirror symmetry in two-dimensional topological quantum field theories should be considered as a main result of this note.',

This is because no physical quantity can be measured in a point, but in a region, the size of which is constrained by the resolution of measuring equipment. The incorporation of the resolution into the definition of quantum fields and appropriate change of Feynman rules results in finite values of the Green functions.

For regions in the space of coupling constants zeta_ pm where H is quasi-Hermitian and there are no complex bound states or spectral singularities, we construct a (positive-definite) metric operator eta and the corresponding equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian h. eta turns out to be a (perturbatively) bounded operator for the cases that the imaginary part of the coupling constants have opposite sign, Im( zeta_+) = - Im( zeta_-). This in particular contains the PT-symmetric case: zeta_+ = zeta_-^*.

	{'abstract': u'The syntactic topic model (STM) is a Bayesian nonparametric model of language that discovers latent distributions of words (topics) that are both semantically and syntactically coherent. The STM models dependency parsed corpora where sentences are grouped into documents. It assumes that each word is drawn from a latent topic chosen by combining document-level features and the local syntactic context. Each document has a distribution over latent topics, as in topic models, which provides the semantic consistency. Each element in the dependency parse tree also has a distribution over the topics of its children, as in latent-state syntax models, which provides the syntactic consistency. These distributions are convolved so that the topic of each word is likely under both its document and syntactic context. We derive a fast posterior inference algorithm based on variational methods. We report qualitative and quantitative studies on both synthetic data and hand-parsed documents. We show that the STM is a more predictive model of language than current models based only on syntax or only on topics.',

	{'abstract': u'The Gaudin model based on the sl_2-invariant r-matrix with an extra Jordanian term depending on the spectral parameters is considered. The appropriate creation operators defining the Bethe states of the system are constructed through a recurrence relation. The commutation relations between the generating function t( lambda) of the integrals of motion and the creation operators are calculated and therefore the algebraic Bethe Ansatz is fully implemented. The energy spectrum as well as the corresponding Bethe equations of the system coincide with the ones of the sl_2-invariant Gaudin model. As opposed to the sl_2-invariant case, the operator t( lambda) and the Gaudin Hamiltonians are not hermitian. Finally, the inner products and norms of the Bethe states are studied.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the category of finite dimensional representations of the quantum double of a finite group as a modular tensor category. We study auto-equivalences of this category whose induced permutations on the set of simple objects (particles) are of the special form of PJ, where J sends every particle to its charge conjugation and P is a transposition of a chargeon-fluxion pair. We prove that if the underlying group is the semidirect product of the additive and multiplicative groups of a finite field, then such an auto-equivalence exists. In particular, we show that for S_3 (the permutation group over three letters) there is a chargeon and a fluxion which are not distinguishable. Conversely, by considering such permutations as modular invariants, we show that a transposition of a chargeon-fluxion pair forms a modular invariant if and only if the corresponding group is isomorphic to the semidirect product of the additive and multiplicative groups of a finite near-field.',

	{'abstract': u"Scaling symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations are generally not variational symmetries of the action and do not lead to conservation laws. Nevertheless, by an extension of Noether's theorem, scaling symmetries lead to useful laws, which still reduce the Euler-Lagrange equations to first order in terms of scale invariants. We illustrate scaling symmetry dynamically and statically. Applied dynamically to systems of bodies interacting via central forces, the nonconservation law is Lagrange's identity, leading to generalized virial laws. Applied to self-gravitating spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium, the nonconservation law leads to well-known properties of polytropes describing degenerate stars and chemically homogeneous nondegenerate stellar cores.",

	{'abstract': u"We show that correlators of the hermitian one-Matrix model with a general potential can be mapped to the counting of certain triples of permutations and hence to counting of holomorphic maps from world-sheet to sphere target with three branch points on the target. This allows the use of old matrix model results to derive new explicit formulae for a class of Hurwitz numbers. Holomorphic maps with three branch points are related, by Belyi's theorem, to curves and maps defined over algebraic numbers . This shows that the string theory dual of the one-matrix model at generic couplings has worldsheets defined over the algebraic numbers and a target space . The absolute Galois group acts on the Feynman diagrams of the 1-matrix model, which are related to Grothendieck's Dessins d'Enfants. Correlators of multi-matrix models are mapped to the counting of triples of permutations subject to equivalences defined by subgroups of the permutation groups. This is related to colorings of the edges of the Grothendieck Dessins. The colored-edge Dessins are useful as a tool for describing some known invariants of the action on Grothendieck Dessins and for defining new invariants.",

	{'abstract': u'A novel tool for tsunami wave modelling is presented. This tool has the potential of being used for operational purposes: indeed, the numerical code VOLNA is able to handle the complete life-cycle of a tsunami (generation, propagation and run-up along the coast). The algorithm works on unstructured triangular meshes and thus can be run in arbitrary complex domains. This paper contains the detailed description of the finite volume scheme implemented in the code. The numerical treatment of the wet/dry transition is explained. This point is crucial for accurate run-up/run-down computations. Most existing tsunami codes use semi-empirical techniques at this stage, which are not always sufficient for tsunami hazard mitigation. Indeed the decision to evacuate inhabitants is based on inundation maps which are produced with this type of numerical tools. We present several realistic test cases that partially validate our algorithm. Comparisons with analytical solutions and experimental data are performed. Finally the main conclusions are outlined and the perspectives for future research presented.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper extends Edgeworth-Cornish-Fisher expansions for the distribution and quantiles of nonparametric estimates in two ways. Firstly it allows observations to have different distributions. Secondly it allows the observations to be weighted in a predetermined way. The use of weighted estimates has a long history including applications to regression, rank statistics and Bayes theory. However, asymptotic results have generally been only first order (the CLT and weak convergence). We give third order asymptotics for the distribution and percentiles of any smooth functional of a weighted empirical distribution, thus allowing a considerable increase in accuracy over earlier CLT results. Consider independent non-identically distributed () observations in . Let be their with weights . We obtain cumulant expansions and hence Edgeworth-Cornish-Fisher expansions for for any smooth functional by extending the concepts of von Mises derivatives to signed measures of total measure 1. As an example we give the cumulant coefficients needed for Edgeworth-Cornish-Fisher expansions to for the sample variance when observations are non-iid.',

	{'abstract': u'The group of automorphisms of Euclidean (embedded in ) dense lattices such as the root lattices and , the Barnes-Wall lattice , the unimodular lattice and the Leech lattice may be generated by entangled quantum gates of the corresponding dimension. These (real) gates/lattices are useful for quantum error correction: for instance, the two and four-qubit real Clifford groups are the automorphism groups of the lattices and , respectively, and the three-qubit real Clifford group is maximal in the Weyl group . Technically, the automorphism group of the lattice is the set of orthogonal matrices such that, following the conjugation action by the generating matrix of the lattice, the output matrix is unimodular (of determinant , with integer entries). When the degree is equal to the number of basis elements of , then also acts on basis vectors and is generated with matrices such that the sum of squared entries in a row is one, i.e. may be seen as a quantum gate. For the dense lattices listed above, maximal multipartite entanglement arises. In particular, one finds a balanced tripartite entanglement in (the two- and three- tangles have equal magnitude 1/4) and a GHZ type entanglement in BW. In this paper, we also investigate the entangled gates from and , by seeing them as systems coupling a qutrit to two- and three-qubits, respectively.

	{'abstract': u'One would often like to know when two a priori distinct extremal black p-brane solutions are in fact U-duality related. In the classical supergravity limit the answer for a large class of theories has been known for some time. However, in the full quantum theory the U-duality group is broken to a discrete subgroup and the question of U-duality orbits in this case is a nuanced matter. In the present work we address this issue in the context of N=8 supergravity in four, five and six dimensions. The purpose of this note is to present and clarify what is currently known about these discrete orbits while at the same time filling in some of the details not yet appearing in the literature. To this end we exploit the mathematical framework of integral Jordan algebras and Freudenthal triple systems. The charge vector of the dyonic black string in D=6 is SO(5,5;Z) related to a two-charge reduced canonical form uniquely specified by a set of two arithmetic U-duality invariants. Similarly, the black hole (string) charge vectors in D=5 are E_(Z) equivalent to a three-charge canonical form, again uniquely fixed by a set of three arithmetic U-duality invariants. The situation in four dimensions is less clear: while black holes preserving more than 1/8 of the supersymmetries may be fully classified by known arithmetic E_(Z) invariants, 1/8-BPS and non-BPS black holes yield increasingly subtle orbit structures, which remain to be properly understood. However, for the very special subclass of projective black holes a complete classification is known. All projective black holes are E_(Z) related to a four or five charge canonical form determined uniquely by the set of known arithmetic U-duality invariants. Moreover, E_(Z) acts transitively on the charge vectors of black holes with a given leading-order entropy.',

	{'abstract': u'In query learning, the goal is to identify an unknown object while minimizing the number of "yes" or "no" questions (queries) posed about that object. A well-studied algorithm for query learning is known as generalized binary search (GBS). We show that GBS is a greedy algorithm to optimize the expected number of queries needed to identify the unknown object. We also generalize GBS in two ways. First, we consider the case where the cost of querying grows exponentially in the number of queries and the goal is to minimize the expected exponential cost. Then, we consider the case where the objects are partitioned into groups, and the objective is to identify only the group to which the object belongs. We derive algorithms to address these issues in a common, information-theoretic framework. In particular, we present an exact formula for the objective function in each case involving Shannon or Renyi entropy, and develop a greedy algorithm for minimizing it. Our algorithms are demonstrated on two applications of query learning, active learning and emergency response.',

We classify completely their constituents in terms of their principal periodic vector k, that we call momentum. We derive a simple relation between the momentum of a string and its density of particles, E, which is reminiscent of a dispersion relation, E=k^2. Strings interact: they can merge and split and within these processes momentum is conserved. We reveal the role of the modular group SL(2,Z) behind these laws.',

	{'abstract': u'I argue that we must distinguish between: (0) the Three-Doors-Problem Problem [sic], which is to make sense of some real world question of a real person. (1) a large number of solutions to this meta-problem, i.e., many specific Three-Doors-Problem problems, which are competing mathematizations of the meta-problem (0). Each of the solutions at level (1) can well have a number of different solutions: nice ones and ugly ones; correct ones and incorrect ones. I discuss three level (1) solutions, i.e., three different Monty Hall problems; and try to give three short correct and attractive solutions. These are: an unconditional probability question; a conditional probability question; and a game-theory question. The meta-message of the article is that applied statisticians should beware of solution-driven science.',

The method we use is based on an article of Brignall, Ruskuc and Vatter which presents a decision procedure (of high complexity) for solving this question, without the assumption that Av(B) is wreath-closed. Using combinatorial, algorithmic and language theoretic arguments together with one of our previous results on pin-permutations, we are able to transform the problem into a co-finiteness problem in a complete deterministic automaton.',

For this equation the analytical form of the steady states is found for various realizations of the random fraction of the sum which is shared to the agents. Among others, Gibbs distribution appears as steady state in case of a uniformly distributed random fraction, while Gamma distribution appears for a random fraction which is Beta distributed. The case in which the gambling game is only conservative-in-the-mean is shown to lead to an explicit heavy tailed distribution.',

These risk measures take into account not only the amounts but also the timing of a cash flow. We discuss their robust representation in terms of suitably penalized probability measures on the optional sigma-field. This yields an explicit analysis both of model and discounting ambiguity. We focus on supermartingale criteria for different notions of time consistency. In particular we show how bubbles may appear in the dynamic penalization, and how they cause a breakdown of asymptotic safety of the risk assessment procedure.',

	{'abstract': u'A nonlinear Schrodinger equation arising from light propagation down an inhomogeneous medium is considered. The inhomogeneity is reflected through a non-uniform coefficient of the non-linear term in the equation. In particular, a combination of self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearity, with the self-defocusing region localized in a finite interval, is investigated. Using numerical computations, the extension of linear eigenmodes of the corresponding linearized system into nonlinear states is established, particularly nonlinear continuations of the fundamental state and the first excited state. The (in)stability of the states is also numerically calculated, from which it is obtained that symmetric nonlinear solutions become unstable beyond a critical threshold norm. Instability of the symmetric states is then investigated analytically through the application of a topological argument. Determination of instability of positive symmetric states is reduced to simple geometric properties of the composite phase plane orbit of the standing wave. Further the topological argument is applied to higher excited states and instability is again reduced to straightforward geometric calculations. For a relatively high norm, it is observed that asymmetric states bifurcate from the symmetric ones. The stability and instability of asymmetric states is also considered.',

	{'abstract': u'Typical protocols for peer-to-peer file sharing over the Internet divide files to be shared into pieces. New peers strive to obtain a complete collection of pieces from other peers and from a seed. In this paper we investigate a problem that can occur if the seeding rate is not large enough. The problem is that, even if the statistics of the system are symmetric in the pieces, there can be symmetry breaking, with one piece becoming very rare. If peers depart after obtaining a complete collection, they can tend to leave before helping other peers receive the rare piece. Assuming that peers arrive with no pieces, there is a single seed, random peer contacts are made, random useful pieces are downloaded, and peers depart upon receiving the complete file, the system is stable if the seeding rate (in pieces per time unit) is greater than the arrival rate, and is unstable if the seeding rate is less than the arrival rate. The result persists for any piece selection policy that selects from among useful pieces, such as rarest first, and it persists with the use of network coding.',

We systematically investigate to classify new exact travelling wave solutions expressible in terms of quasi-periodic elliptic integral function and doubly-periodic Jacobian elliptic functions. The derived new solutions include rational, periodic, singular and solitary wave solutions. An interesting comparison with the canonical procedure is provided. In some cases the obtained elliptic solution has singularity at certain region in the whole space.

	{'abstract': u"This paper describes a method for deriving approximate equations for irrotational water waves. The method is based on a 'relaxed' variational principle, i.e., on a Lagrangian involving as many variables as possible. This formulation is particularly suitable for the construction of approximate water wave models, since it allows more freedom while preserving the variational structure. The advantages of this relaxed formulation are illustrated with various examples in shallow and deep waters, as well as arbitrary depths. Using subordinate constraints (e.g., irrotationality or free surface impermeability) in various combinations, several model equations are derived, some being well-known, other being new. The models obtained are studied analytically and exact travelling wave solutions are constructed when possible.",

For example, for strong magnetic field lambda_n = C exp, here tau_0&gt;0 and C &gt; 0 depend on the anisotropy and the magnetic field. Different eigenvalues are degenerated differently. The largest eigenvalue is unique, but the degeneracy g_n increases sub-exponentially as eigenvalues diminish: g_n sim exp). For weak magnetic field expressions are similar.',

	{'abstract': u'The optimal reconstruction of cosmic metric perturbations and other signals requires knowledge of their power spectra and other parameters. If these are not known a priori, they have to be measured simultaneously from the same data used for the signal reconstruction. We formulate the general problem of signal inference in the presence of unknown parameters within the framework of information field theory. We develop a generic parameter uncertainty renormalized estimation (PURE) technique and address the problem of reconstructing Gaussian signals with unknown power-spectrum with five different approaches: (i) separate maximum-a-posteriori power spectrum measurement and subsequent reconstruction, (ii) maximum-a-posteriori power reconstruction with marginalized power-spectrum, (iii) maximizing the joint posterior of signal and spectrum, (iv) guessing the spectrum from the variance in the Wiener filter map, and (v) renormalization flow analysis of the field theoretical problem providing the PURE filter. In all cases, the reconstruction can be described or approximated as Wiener filter operations with assumed signal spectra derived from the data according to the same recipe, but with differing coefficients. All of these filters, except the renormalized one, exhibit a perception threshold in case of a Jeffreys prior for the unknown spectrum. Data modes, with variance below this threshold do not affect the signal reconstruction at all. Filter (iv) seems to be similar to the so called Karhune-Loeve and Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock estimators for galaxy power spectra used in cosmology, which therefore should also exhibit a marginal perception threshold if correctly implemented. We present statistical performance tests and show that the PURE filter is superior to the others.',

The answer for this question can be connected with unique phenomenon arising from Riemann space transition used in GTR, to Weyl space used in CGD. We have in mind the possibility to set up the perfect correspondence in certain spatial regions between the equations of different physical phenomena: (1) Phenomena associated with Weyl degrees of freedom in a plane space. (2) Phenomena described in terms of half-integer spin particles and observed quantities corresponding to the full set of bispinors. The said phenomenon is described in the present paper. Analyzed here are the new prospects in the problem of combination of quantum physics concepts and GTR, unification of physical interactions and understanding of many of the effects known from the experiments but not properly understood yet.',

In this framework, the group of automorphisms of some suitable principal bundle P, called the structure bundle, acts on fields by means of gauge transformations. After showing that the classical Wess-Zumino model can be consistently described within this formalism, we consider minimal supergravity (mSugra). We find that to embed mSugra in a Gauge-Natural framework, further investigations are needed. This happens since both the covariance of the Rarita-Schwinger Lagrangian and the closure of the SUSY algebra occur on-shell.',

	{'abstract': u'While multipartite quantum states constitute a (if not the) key resource for quantum computations and protocols, obtaining a high-level, structural understanding of entanglement involving arbitrarily many qubits is a long-standing open problem in quantum computer science. In this paper we expose the algebraic and graphical structure of the GHZ-state and the W-state, as well as a purely graphical distinction that characterises the behaviours of these states. In turn, this structure yields a compositional graphical model for expressing general multipartite states. We identify those states, named Frobenius states, which canonically induce an algebraic structure, namely the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra (CFA). We show that all SLOCC-maximal tripartite qubit states are locally equivalent to Frobenius states. Those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the GHZ-state induce special commutative Frobenius algebras, while those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the W-state induce what we call anti-special commutative Frobenius algebras. From the SLOCC-classification of tripartite qubit states follows a representation theorem for two dimensional CFAs. Together, a GHZ and a W Frobenius state form the primitives of a graphical calculus. This calculus is expressive enough to generate and reason about arbitrary multipartite states, which are obtained by "composing" the GHZ- and W-states, giving rise to a rich graphical paradigm for general multipartite entanglement.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the quantum channel version of Shannon\'s zero-error capacity problem. Motivated by recent progress on this question, we propose to consider a certain operator space as the quantum generalisation of the adjacency matrix, in terms of which the plain, quantum and entanglement-assisted capacity can be formulated, and for which we show some new basic properties. Most importantly, we define a quantum version of Lovasz\' famous theta function, as the norm-completion (or stabilisation) of a "naive" generalisation of theta. We go on to show that this function upper bounds the number of entanglement-assisted zero-error messages, that it is given by a semidefinite programme, whose dual we write down explicitly, and that it is multiplicative with respect to the natural (strong) graph product. We explore various other properties of the new quantity, which reduces to Lovasz\' original theta in the classical case, give several applications, and propose to study the operator spaces associated to channels as "non-commutative graphs", using the language of Hilbert modules.',

This quantity is hard to compute even for small graphs such as the cycle of length seven, so upper bounds such as the Lovasz theta function play an important role in zero-error communication. In this paper, we show that the Lovasz theta function is an upper bound on the zero-error capacity even in the presence of entanglement between the sender and receiver.',

	{'abstract': u'Following Hartigan, a cluster is defined as a connected component of the t-level set of the underlying density, i.e., the set of points for which the density is greater than t. A clustering algorithm which combines a density estimate with spectral clustering techniques is proposed. Our algorithm is composed of two steps. First, a nonparametric density estimate is used to extract the data points for which the estimated density takes a value greater than t. Next, the extracted points are clustered based on the eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix. Under mild assumptions, we prove the almost sure convergence in operator norm of the empirical graph Laplacian operator associated with the algorithm. Furthermore, we give the typical behavior of the representation of the dataset into the feature space, which establishes the strong consistency of our proposed algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'The basic goal in combinatorial group testing is to identify a set of up to defective items within a large population of size using a pooling strategy. Namely, the items can be grouped together in pools, and a single measurement would reveal whether there are one or more defectives in the pool. The threshold model is a generalization of this idea where a measurement returns positive if the number of defectives in the pool reaches a fixed threshold , negative if this number is no more than a fixed lower threshold , and may behave arbitrarily otherwise. We study non-adaptive threshold group testing (in a possibly noisy setting) and show that, for this problem, measurements (where and is any fixed constant) suffice to identify the defectives, and also present almost matching lower bounds. This significantly improves the previously known (non-constructive) upper bound . Moreover, we obtain a framework for explicit construction of measurement schemes using lossless condensers. The number of measurements resulting from this scheme is ideally bounded by . Using state-of-the-art constructions of lossless condensers, however, we obtain explicit testing schemes with and measurements, for arbitrary constant .',

The effect of barrier width on the transmission coefficient of the electrons has been investigated for different pairs of semi conducting materials that are gaining much importance recently. These pairs include CdS/CdSe, AlGaAs/GaAs and InAs/AlSb. Barrier dimensions have been reduced from 20nm to 5nm to observe the effect of scaling on tunneling properties. Material depended is highlighted for electrons with energy varying from below the barrier height to above it. The electron effective mass inside the barrier and the well are often different. The results show that the coupling effect leads to significant changes on the transmission effect. . The effective-mass dependant transmission coefficient has been plotted with respect to electron energy. The computation is based on the transfer matrix method by using MATLAB.',

	{'abstract': u'We provide a framework for Bell inequalities which is based on multilinear contractions. The derivation of the inequalities allows for an intuitive geometric depiction and their violation within quantum mechanics can be seen as a direct consequence of non-vanishing commutators. The approach is motivated by generalizing recent work on non-linear inequalities which was based on the moduli of complex numbers, quaternions and octonions. We extend results on Peres conjecture about the validity of Bell inequalities for quantum states with positive partial transposes. Moreover, we show the possibility of obtaining unbounded quantum violations albeit we also prove that quantum mechanics can only violate the derived inequalities if three or more parties are involved.',

Each of the BPS state contributing to the BPS index is in one-to-one correspondence with a configuration of a molten crystal, and the statistical partition function of the melting crystal gives the BPS partition function. We also show that smooth geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold emerges in the thermodynamic limit of the crystal. This suggests a remarkable interpretation that an atom in the crystal is a discretization of the classical geometry, giving an important clue as to the geometry at the Planck scale.In the second part we discuss the wall crossing phenomena. Wall crossing phenomena states that the BPS index depends on the value of the moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold, and jumps along real codimension one subspaces in the moduli space. We show that by using type IIA/M-theory duality, we can provide a simple and an intuitive derivation of the wall crossing phenomena, furthermore clarifying the connection with the topological string theory. This derivation is consistent with another derivation from the wall crossing formula, motivated by multi-centered BPS extremal black holes. We also explain the representation of the wall crossing phenomena in terms of crystal melting, and the generalization of the counting problem and the wall crossing to the open BPS invariants.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose two analytically tractable stochastic models of non-slotted Aloha for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs): one model assumes a static pattern of nodes while the other assumes that the pattern of nodes varies over time. Both models feature transmitters randomly located in the Euclidean plane, according to a Poisson point process with the receivers randomly located at a fixed distance from the emitters. We concentrate on the so-called outage scenario, where a successful transmission requires a Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) larger than a given threshold. With Rayleigh fading and the SINR averaged over the duration of the packet transmission, both models lead to closed form expressions for the probability of successful transmission. We show an excellent matching of these results with simulations. Using our models we compare the performances of non-slotted Aloha to previously studied slotted Aloha. We observe that when the path loss is not very strong both models, when appropriately optimized, exhibit similar performance. For stronger path loss non-slotted Aloha performs worse than slotted Aloha, however when the path loss exponent is equal to 4 its density of successfully received packets is still 75% of that in the slotted scheme. This is still much more than the 50% predicted by the well-known analysis where simultaneous transmissions are never successful. Moreover, in any path loss scenario, both schemes exhibit the same energy efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'The past decade has demonstrated increasing interests in using optimal control based methods within coherent quantum controllable systems. The versatility of such methods has been demonstrated with particular elegance within nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) where natural separation between coherent and dissipative spin dynamics processes has enabled coherent quantum control over long periods of time to shape the experiment to almost ideal adoption to the spin system and external manipulations. This has led to new design principles as well as powerful new experimental methods within magnetic resonance imaging, liquid-state and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. For this development to continue and expand, it is crucially important to constantly improve the underlying numerical algorithms to provide numerical solutions which are optimally compatible with implementation on current instrumentation and at same time are numerically stable and offer fast monotonic convergence towards the target. Addressing such aims, we here present a smoothing monotonically convergent algorithm for pulse sequence design in magnetic resonance which with improved optimization stability lead to smooth pulse sequence easier to implement experimentally and potentially understand within the analytical framework of modern NMR spectroscopy.',

	{'abstract': u'A field known as Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently emerged to help address the growing challenges of capturing and processing high-dimensional signals and data sets. CS exploits the surprising fact that the information contained in a sparse signal can be preserved in a small number of compressive (or random) linear measurements of that signal. Strong theoretical guarantees have been established on the accuracy to which sparse or near-sparse signals can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Building upon recent results concerning the stable embeddings of manifolds within the measurement space, we establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal bounds in for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation from noisy compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for sparsity-based CS, we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the probabilistic setting. Our work supports the growing empirical evidence that manifold-based models can be used with high accuracy in compressive signal processing.',

	{'abstract': u'Non-commutative Quantum Mechanics in 3D is investigated in the framework of the abelian Drinfeld twist which deforms a given Hopf algebra while preserving its Hopf algebra structure. Composite operators (of coordinates and momenta) entering the Hamiltonian have to be reinterpreted as primitive elements of a dynamical Lie algebra which could be either finite (for the harmonic oscillator) or infinite (in the general case). The deformed brackets of the deformed angular momenta close the so(3) algebra. On the other hand, undeformed rotationally invariant operators can become, under deformation, anomalous (the anomaly vanishes when the deformation parameter goes to zero). The deformed operators, Taylor-expanded in the deformation parameter, can be selected to minimize the anomaly. We present the deformations (and their anomalies) of undeformed rotationally-invariant operators corresponding to the harmonic oscillator (quadratic potential), the anharmonic oscillator (quartic potential) and the Coulomb potential.',

We call this approach to QFT the No-Counterterm approach. We show how to compute the No-Counterterm perturbation series for the model in .

	{'abstract': u'We consider Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) with transmitters located according to a Poisson point in the Euclidean plane, slotted Aloha Medium Access (MAC) protocol and the so-called outage scenario, where a successful transmission requires a Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise (SINR) larger than some threshold. We analyze the local delays in such a network, namely the number of times slots required for nodes to transmit a packet to their prescribed next-hop receivers. The analysis depends very much on the receiver scenario and on the variability of the fading. In most cases, each node has finite-mean geometric random delay and thus a positive next hop throughput. However, the spatial (or large population) averaging of these individual finite mean-delays leads to infinite values in several practical cases, including the Rayleigh fading and positive thermal noise case. In some cases it exhibits an interesting phase transition phenomenon where the spatial average is finite when certain model parameters are below a threshold and infinite above. We call this phenomenon, contention phase transition. We argue that the spatial average of the mean local delays is infinite primarily because of the outage logic, where one transmits full packets at time slots when the receiver is covered at the required SINR and where one wastes all the other time slots. This results in the "RESTART" mechanism, which in turn explains why we have infinite spatial average. Adaptive coding offers a nice way of breaking the outage/RESTART logic. We show examples where the average delays are finite in the adaptive coding case, whereas they are infinite in the outage case.',

The answer is positive if intrinsic or Ziezold means are used. The underlying general result of manifold stability of a mean on a shape space, the quotient due to an isometric action of a compact Lie group on a Riemannian manifold, blends the Slice Theorem from differential geometry with the statistics of shape. For 3D Procrustes means, however, a counterexample is given. To further elucidate on subtleties of means, for spheres and Kendall's shape spaces, a first order relationship between intrinsic, residual/Procrustean and extrinsic/Ziezold means is derived stating that for high concentration the latter approximately divides the (generalized) geodesic segment between the former two by the ratio . This fact, consequences of coordinate choices for the power of tests and other details, e.g. that extrinsic Schoenberg means may increase dimension are discussed and illustrated by simulations and exemplary datasets.",

	{'abstract': u"In the statistical analysis of shape a goal beyond the analysis of static shapes lies in the quantification of `same' deformation of different shapes. Typically, shape spaces are modelled as Riemannian manifolds on which parallel transport along geodesics naturally qualifies as a measure for the `similarity' of deformation. Since these spaces are usually defined as combinations of Riemannian immersions and submersions, only for few well featured spaces such as spheres or complex projective spaces (which are Kendall's spaces for 2D shapes), parallel transport along geodesics can be computed explicitly. In this contribution a general numerical method to compute parallel transport along geodesics when no explicit formula is available is provided. This method is applied to the shape spaces of closed 2D contours based on angular direction and to Kendall's spaces of shapes of arbitrary dimension. In application to the temporal evolution of leaf shape over a growing period, one leaf's shape-growth dynamics can be applied to another leaf. For a specific poplar tree investigated it is found that leaves of initially and terminally different shape evolve rather parallel, i.e. with comparable dynamics.",

	{'abstract': u'The densest local packings of N identical nonoverlapping spheres within a radius Rmin(N) of a fixed central sphere of the same size are obtained using a nonlinear programming method operating in conjunction with a stochastic search of configuration space. Knowledge of Rmin(N) in d-dimensional Euclidean space allows for the construction both of a realizability condition for pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal density of infinite sphere packings. In this paper, we focus on the two-dimensional circular disk problem. We find and present the putative densest packings and corresponding Rmin(N) for selected values of N up to N = 348 and use this knowledge to construct such a realizability condition and upper bound. We additionally analyze the properties and characteristics of the maximally dense packings, finding significant variability in their symmetries and contact networks, and that the vast majority differ substantially from the triangular lattice even for large N. Our work has implications for packaging problems, nucleation theory, and surface physics.',

	{'abstract': u'Numerical computations of stationary states of fast-rotating Bose-Einstein condensates require high spatial resolution due to the presence of a large number of quantized vortices. In this paper we propose a low-order finite element method with mesh adaptivity by metric control, as an alternative approach to the commonly used high order (finite difference or spectral) approximation methods. The mesh adaptivity is used with two different numerical algorithms to compute stationary vortex states: an imaginary time propagation method and a Sobolev gradient descent method. We first address the basic issue of the choice of the variable used to compute new metrics for the mesh adaptivity and show that simultaneously refinement using the real and imaginary part of the solution is successful. Mesh refinement using only the modulus of the solution as adaptivity variable fails for complicated test cases. Then we suggest an optimized algorithm for adapting the mesh during the evolution of the solution towards the equilibrium state. Considerable computational time saving is obtained compared to uniform mesh computations. The new method is applied to compute difficult cases relevant for physical experiments (large nonlinear interaction constant and high rotation rates).',

It is shown that finiteness of the output entropy of a positive map on the whole input state space implies its continuity. Sufficient conditions for this property expressed in terms of the Kraus representation of quantum channels and operations are presented. The characterization of a positive map "preserving continuity of the entropy" (in the sense that continuity of the entropy on a set of input states implies continuity of its output entropy on this set) is obtained and its applications to the class of quantum operations are considered. The special relation between continuity properties of the output entropies of complementary quantum operations is established and its corollaries are discussed. Continuity conditions for the output entropy of positive maps considered as a function of a pair (map, input state) are also obtained. Several applications to the quantum information theory are presented in the last part of the paper.',

A scattering matrix without bound states defines an isolated equilibrium system. Bound states instead drive the system away from equilibrium, giving raise to non-trivial incoming or outgoing energy flows in the junction.

The main mathematical tool for this purpose is cluster analysis, combined with a statistical test for outliers. We carry out the research with two letters, i and a. In the first case, an exact clustering method is employed; in the second, with more specimens to be classified, we resort to an approximate agglomerative clustering method. The results show that the letters form clusters according to their shape, with significant shape differences among clusters, and allow to conclude, with a very small probability of error, that indeed the metal types used to print them were cast from several different matrices.

The methods provide continuous time interpolation between the time steps, thereby revealing the maps to be quasi-Hamiltonian systems underlain by novel potentials that govern the motion of a perceived point particle. Between turning points, the particle is strictly driven by Hamiltonian dynamics, but at each encounter with a turning point the potential changes abruptly, loosely analogous to the switchbacks on a mountain road. A sequence of successively deepening switchback potentials explains, in physical terms, the frequency cascade and trajectory folding that occur on the particular route to chaos revealed by the logistic map.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider instanton solutions of Euclidean Horava-Lifshitz gravity in four dimensions satisfying the detailed balance condition. They are described by geometric flows in three dimensions driven by certain combinations of the Cotton and Ricci tensors as well as the cosmological-constant term. The deformation curvature terms can have competing behavior leading to a variety of fixed points. The instantons interpolate between any two fixed points, which are vacua of topologically massive gravity with Lambda &gt; 0, and their action is finite. Special emphasis is placed on configurations with SU(2) isometry associated with homogeneous but generally non-isotropic Bianchi IX model geometries. In this case, the combined Ricci-Cotton flow reduces to an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations whose properties are studied in detail for different couplings. The occurrence and stability of isotropic and anisotropic fixed points are investigated analytically and some exact solutions are obtained. The corresponding instantons are classified and they are all globally R x S^3 and complete spaces. Generalizations to higher-dimensional gravities are also briefly discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'Given a two-dimensional quantum field theory with (0,2) supersymmetry, one can construct a chiral (or vertex) algebra. The chiral algebra of a (0,2) supersymmetric sigma model is, perturbatively, the cohomology of a sheaf of chiral differential operators on a string K "ahler manifold. However, it vanishes in some cases when instantons are taken into account. I will discuss the implication of this phenomenon for the H "ohn-Stolz conjecture on the Witten genus.',

	{'abstract': u'We observe that the vocabulary used to construct the "answer" to problems in computer algebra can have a dramatic effect on the computational complexity of solving that problem. We recall a formalization of this observation and explain the classic example of sparse polynomial arithmetic. For this case, we show that it is possible to extend the vocabulary so as reap the benefits of conciseness whilst avoiding the obvious pitfall of repeating the problem statement as the "solution". It is possible to extend the vocabulary either by irreducible cyclotomics or by : we look at the options and suggest that the pragmatist might opt for both.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we establish a constructive method in order to show global existence and regularity for a class of degenerate parabolic Cauchy problems which satisfy a weak Hoermander condition on a subset of the domain where the data are measurable and which have regular data on the complementary set of the domain. This result has practical incentives related to the computation of Greeks in reduced LIBOR market models, which are standard computable approximations of the HJM-description of interest rate markets. The method leads to a probabilistic scheme for the computation of the value function and its sensitivities based on Malliavin calculus. From a practical perspective the main contribution of the paper is an Monte-Carlo algorithm which includes weight corrections for paths which move in time into a region where a (weak) Hoermander condition holds.',

	{'abstract': u'We define a q-deformation of the Dirac operator, inspired by the one dimensional q-derivative. This implies a q-deformation of the partial derivatives. By taking the square of this Dirac operator we find a q-deformation of the Laplace operator. This allows to construct q-deformed Schroedinger equations in higher dimensions. The equivalence of these Schroedinger equations with those defined on q-Euclidean space in quantum variables is shown. We also define the m-dimensional q-Clifford-Hermite polynomials and show their connection with the q-Laguerre polynomials. These polynomials are orthogonal with respect to an m-dimensional q-integration, which is related to integration on q-Euclidean space. The q-Laguerre polynomials are the eigenvectors of an su_q(1|1)-representation.',

	{'abstract': u'We describe the birational correspondences, induced by the Fourier-Mukai functor, between moduli spaces of semistable sheaves on elliptic surfaces with sections, using the notion of -stability in the derived category. We give explicit conditions to determine whether these correspondences are isomorphisms. This is indeed not true in general and we describe the cases where the birational maps are Mukai flops. Moreover, this construction provides examples of new compactifications of the moduli spaces of vector bundles via sheaves with torsion and via complexes. We finally get for any fixed dimension an isomorphism between the Picard groups of the moduli spaces.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a generalization of the weighted random ball model. The model is driven by a random Poisson measure with a product heavy tailed intensity measure. Such a model typically represents the transmission of a network of stations with a fading effect. In a previous article, the authors proved the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of related generalized random fields under various scalings and in the particular case when the fading function is the indicator function of the unit ball. In this paper, tightness and functional convergence are investigated. Using suitable moment estimates, we prove functional convergences for some parametric classes of configurations under the so-called large ball scaling and intermediate ball scaling. Convergence in the space of distributions is also discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is to study some possibly degenerate elliptic equation in a bounded domain with a nonlinear boundary condition involving measure data. We investigate two types of problems: the first one deals with the laplacian in a bounded domain with measure supported on the domain and on the boundary. A second one deals with the same type of data but involves a degenerate weight in the equation. In both cases, the nonlinearity under consideration lies on the boundary. For the first problem, we prove an optimal regularity result, whereas for the second one the optimality is not guaranteed but we provide however regularity estimates.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we modified the Navier-Stokes equations by adding a higher order artificial viscosity term to the conventional system. We first show that the solution of the regularized system converges strongly to the solution of the conventional system as the regularization parameter goes to zero, for each dimension d 4. Then we show that the use of this artificial viscosity term leads to truncated the number of degrees of freedom in the long-time behavior of the solutions to these equations. This result suggests that the hyperviscous Navier-Stokes system is an interesting model for three-dimensional fluid turbulence.',

	{'abstract': u'The simulation of the metabolism in mammalian cells becomes a severe problem if spatial distributions must be taken into account. Especially the cytoplasm has a very complex geometric structure which cannot be handled by standard discretization techniques. In the present paper we propose a homogenization technique for computing effective diffusion constants. This is accomplished by using a two-step strategy. The first step consists of an analytic homogenization from the smallest to an intermediate scale. The homogenization error is estimated by comparing the analytic diffusion constant with a numerical estimate obtained by using real cell geometries. The second step consists of a random homogenization. Since no analytical solution is known to this homogenization problem, a numerical approximation algorithm is proposed. Although rather expensive this algorithm provides a reasonable estimate of the homogenized diffusion constant.',

	{'abstract': u'A modified formulation of the Electroweak Model with 3-dimensional spherical geometry in the target space is suggested. The Lagrangian in the spherical field space along with the standard gauge field Lagrangian form the full Higgsless Lagrangian of the model, whose second order terms reproduce the same experimentally verified fields with the same masses as the Standard Electroweak Model. The vector bosons masses are automatically generated, so there is no need in special mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The limiting case of the modified Higgsless Electroweak Model, which corresponds to the contracted gauge group is discussed. Within framework of the limit model Z-boson, electromagnetic and electron fields are interpreted as an external ones with respect to W-bosons and neutrino fields. The W-bosons and neutrino fields do not effect on these external fields. The masses of all particles remain the same, but the field interactions in contracted model are more simple as compared with the standard Electroweak Model due to nullification of some terms.',

	{'abstract': u"We discuss how recently discovered techniques and tools from compressed sensing can be used in tensor decompositions, with a view towards modeling signals from multiple arrays of multiple sensors. We show that with appropriate bounds on a measure of separation between radiating sources called coherence, one could always guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a best rank-r approximation of the tensor representing the signal. We also deduce a computationally feasible variant of Kruskal's uniqueness condition, where the coherence appears as a proxy for k-rank. Problems of sparsest recovery with an infinite continuous dictionary, lowest-rank tensor representation, and blind source separation are treated in a uniform fashion. The decomposition of the measurement tensor leads to simultaneous localization and extraction of radiating sources, in an entirely deterministic manner.",

	{'abstract': u'The notion of probability density for a random function is not as straightforward as in finite-dimensional cases. While a probability density function generally does not exist for functional data, we show that it is possible to develop the notion of density when functional data are considered in the space determined by the eigenfunctions of principal component analysis. This leads to a transparent and meaningful surrogate for density defined in terms of the average value of the logarithms of the densities of the distributions of principal components for a given dimension. This density approximation is estimable readily from data. It accurately represents, in a monotone way, key features of small-ball approximations to density. Our results on estimators of the densities of principal component scores are also of independent interest; they reveal interesting shape differences that have not previously been considered. The statistical implications of these results and properties are identified and discussed, and practical ramifications are illustrated in numerical work.',

These systems were proposed to model textures in image processing and to represent independence relations between random variables in statistics (in the later case they are known as Bayesian networks). Our chains are a generalization of probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) and their theory has features intermediate between that of discrete-time processes and the theory of statistical mechanical lattice fields. Its proper definition is based on the notion of partially ordered specification (POS), in close analogy to the theory of Gibbs measure. This paper contains two types of results. First, we present the basic elements of the general theory of POCs: basic geometrical issues, definition in terms of conditional probability kernels, extremal decomposition, extremality and triviality, reconstruction starting from single-site kernels, relations between POM and Gibbs fields. Second, we prove three uniqueness criteria that correspond to the criteria known as bounded uniformity, Dobrushin and disagreement percolation in the theory of Gibbs measures.',

	{'abstract': u'We generalize the concept of Sato Grassmannians of locally linearly compact topological vector spaces (Tate spaces) to the category limA of the "locally compact objects" of an exact category A, and study some of their properties. This allows us to generalize the Kapranov dimensional torsor Dim(X) and determinantal gerbe Det(X) for the objects of limA and unify their treatment in the determinantal torsor D(X). We then introduce a class of exact categories, that we call partially abelian exact, and prove that if A is partially abelian exact, Dim(X) and Det(X) are multiplicative in admissible short exact sequences. When A is the category of finite dimensional vector spaces on a field k, we recover the case of the dimensional torsor and of the determinantal gerbe of a Tate space, as defined by Kapranov and reformulate its properties in terms of the Waldhausen space S(A) of the exact category A. The advantage of this approach is that it allows to define formally in the same way the Grassmannians of the iterated categories lim^nA. We then prove that the category of Tate spaces is partially abelian exact, which allows us to extend the results on Dim and Det already known for Tate spaces to 2-Tate spaces, such as the multiplicativity of Dim and Det for 2-Tate spaces, as considered by Arkhipov-Kremnizer and Frenkel-Zhu.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider random fields defined by finite-region conditional probabilities depending on a neighborhood of the region which changes with the boundary conditions. To predict the symbols within any finite region it is necessary to inspect a random number of neighborhood symbols which might change according to the value of them. In analogy to the one dimensional setting we call these neighborhood symbols the context of the region. This framework is a natural extension, to d-dimensional fields, of the notion of variable-length Markov chains introduced by Rissanen (1983) in his classical paper. We define an algorithm to estimate the radius of the smallest ball containing the context based on a realization of the field. We prove the consistency of this estimator. Our proofs are constructive and yield explicit upper bounds for the probability of wrong estimation of the radius of the context.',

	{'abstract': u'We give a complete answer to the analogue of Grothendieck conjecture on p-curvatures for q-difference equations defined over K(x), where K is any finitely generated extension of Q and q in K can be either a transcendental or an algebraic number. This generalizes the results in [DV02], proved under the assumption that K is a number field and q an algebraic number. The results also hold for a field K which is a finite extension of a purely transcendental extension k(q) of a perfect field k. If k is a number field and q is a parameter, one can either reduce the equation modulo a finite place of k or specialize the parameter q, or both. In particular for q=1, we obtain a differential equation defined over a number field or in positive characteristic. In S II, we consider two Galois groups attached to a q-difference module M over K(x): the generic Galois group Gal(M), in the sense of [Kat82]; if char K=0, the generic differential Galois group Gal^D(M), which is a Kolchin differential algebraic group. We deduce an arithmetic description of Gal(M) (resp. Gal^D(M)). In positive characteristic, we prove some devissage. There are many Galois theories for q-difference equations defined over fields such as C, the elliptic functions, or the differential closure of C. In S III, we show that the Galois D-groupoid [Gra09] of a nonlinear q-difference system generalizes Gal^D(M). In S IV we give some comparison results between the two generic Galois groups above and the other Galois groups for linear -difference equations in the literature. We compare: the group introduced in [HS08] with the Gal^D(M) and hence with the Galois D-groupoid (cf [Mal09]); Gal(M) and Gal^D(M) to the generic Galois groups of the modules obtained by specialization of q or by reduction in positive characteristic. We relate the dimension of Gal^D(M) to the differential relations among the solutions of M.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider dimension reduction for regression or classification in which the predictors are matrix- or array-valued. This type of predictor arises when measurements are obtained for each combination of two or more underlying variables--for example, the voltage measured at different channels and times in electroencephalography data. For these applications, it is desirable to preserve the array structure of the reduced predictor (e.g., time versus channel), but this cannot be achieved within the conventional dimension reduction formulation. In this paper, we introduce a dimension reduction method, to be called dimension folding, for matrix- and array-valued predictors that preserves the array structure. In an application of dimension folding to an electroencephalography data set, we correctly classify 97 out of 122 subjects as alcoholic or nonalcoholic based on their electroencephalography in a cross-validation sample.',

The scale adjustment removes the tendency of scale differences to confound differences in means. Certain other distance-based methods, for example, those founded on nearest-neighbor distance, do not have optimal performance in the sense that we propose. Our results permit varying degrees of sparsity and signal strength to be treated, and require only mild conditions on dependence of vector components. Additionally, we permit the marginal distributions of vector components to vary extensively. In addition to providing theory we explore numerical properties of a centroid-based classifier, and show that these features reflect theoretical accounts of performance.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the detection of multivariate spatial clusters in the Bernoulli model with locations, where the design distribution has weakly dependent marginals. The locations are scanned with a rectangular window with sides parallel to the axes and with varying sizes and aspect ratios. Multivariate scan statistics pose a statistical problem due to the multiple testing over many scan windows, as well as a computational problem because statistics have to be evaluated on many windows. This paper introduces methodology that leads to both statistically optimal inference and computationally efficient algorithms. The main difference to the traditional calibration of scan statistics is the concept of grouping scan windows according to their sizes, and then applying different critical values to different groups. It is shown that this calibration of the scan statistic results in optimal inference for spatial clusters on both small scales and on large scales, as well as in the case where the cluster lives on one of the marginals. Methodology is introduced that allows for an efficient approximation of the set of all rectangles while still guaranteeing the statistical optimality results described above. It is shown that the resulting scan statistic has a computational complexity that is almost linear in .',

Our Gibbs sampler exploits the properties of the multinomial and Dirichlet distributions, and is shown to be an improvement, in terms of operator norm and efficiency, over other commonly used MCMC algorithms. We also investigate methods for the estimation of the precision parameter of the Dirichlet process, finding that maximum likelihood may not be desirable, but a posterior mode is a reasonable approach. Examples are given to show how these models perform on real data. Our results complement both the theoretical basis of the Dirichlet process nonparametric prior and the computational work that has been done to date.',

	{'abstract': u'High-frequency data observed on the prices of financial assets are commonly modeled by diffusion processes with micro-structure noise, and realized volatility-based methods are often used to estimate integrated volatility. For problems involving a large number of assets, the estimation objects we face are volatility matrices of large size. The existing volatility estimators work well for a small number of assets but perform poorly when the number of assets is very large. In fact, they are inconsistent when both the number, , of the assets and the average sample size, , of the price data on the assets go to infinity. This paper proposes a new type of estimators for the integrated volatility matrix and establishes asymptotic theory for the proposed estimators in the framework that allows both and to approach to infinity. The theory shows that the proposed estimators achieve high convergence rates under a sparsity assumption on the integrated volatility matrix. The numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform well for large and complex price and volatility models. The proposed method is applied to real high-frequency financial data.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose MC+, a fast, continuous, nearly unbiased and accurate method of penalized variable selection in high-dimensional linear regression. The LASSO is fast and continuous, but biased. The bias of the LASSO may prevent consistent variable selection. Subset selection is unbiased but computationally costly. The MC+ has two elements: a minimax concave penalty (MCP) and a penalized linear unbiased selection (PLUS) algorithm. The MCP provides the convexity of the penalized loss in sparse regions to the greatest extent given certain thresholds for variable selection and unbiasedness. The PLUS computes multiple exact local minimizers of a possibly nonconvex penalized loss function in a certain main branch of the graph of critical points of the penalized loss. Its output is a continuous piecewise linear path encompassing from the origin for infinite penalty to a least squares solution for zero penalty. We prove that at a universal penalty level, the MC+ has high probability of matching the signs of the unknowns, and thus correct selection, without assuming the strong irrepresentable condition required by the LASSO. This selection consistency applies to the case of , and is proved to hold for exactly the MC+ solution among possibly many local minimizers. We prove that the MC+ attains certain minimax convergence rates in probability for the estimation of regression coefficients in balls. We use the SURE method to derive degrees of freedom and -type risk estimates for general penalized LSE, including the LASSO and MC+ estimators, and prove their unbiasedness. Based on the estimated degrees of freedom, we propose an estimator of the noise level for proper choice of the penalty level.',

Note that one of the main paradigms of the CML theory is that the latter behavior is supposed to be generic. The model under consideration is related to dynamical networks and sheds a new light to the problem of synchronization under weak interactions.',

We state the degenerate version of Favard's theorem, which is one of the keys of the paper, that allow us to extend the orthogonality properties valid up to some integer degree N to Sobolev type orthogonality properties. We also present, following an analogous process that applied in [16], tables with the factorization and the discrete Sobolev-type orthogonality property for those families which satisfy a finite orthogonality property, i.e. it consists in sum of finite number of masspoints, such as q-Racah (qR), q-Hahn (qH), dual q-Hahn (dqH), and q-Krawtchouk polynomials (qK), among others. -- [16] R.

A new method is devised to show that this type of composition operators fall in a C*-algebra of Toeplitz operators and Fourier multipliers.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we give a description of the possible poles of the local zeta function attached to a complex or real analytic mapping in terms of a log-principalization of an ideal associated to the mapping. When the mapping is a non-degenerate one, we give an explicit list for the possible poles of the corresponding local zeta function in terms of the normal vectors to the supporting hyperplanes of a Newton polyhedron attached to the mapping, and some additional vectors (or rays) that appear in the construction of a simplicial conical subdivision of the first orthant. These results extend the corresponding results of Varchenko to the case l geq1, and K=R or C. In the case l=1 and K=R, Denef and Sargos proved that the candidates poles induced by the extra rays required in the construction of a simplicial conical subdivision can be discarded from the list of candidate poles. We extend the Denef-Sargos result arbitrary l geq1. This yields in general a much shorter list of candidate poles, that can moreover be read off immediately from the Newton polyhedron.',

The formal language of logic that he developed, enabled him to perceive mathematics with great precision and depth.

	{'abstract': u'We consider the long term behaviour of a Markov chain xi(t) on Z^N based on the N station supermarket model. Different routing policies for the supermarket model give different Markov chains. We show that for a general class of local routing policies, "join the least weighted queue" (JLW), the N one-dimensional components xi_i(t) can be partitioned into disjoint clusters C_k. Within each cluster C_k the "speed" of each component xi_j converges to a constant V_k and under certain conditions xi is recurrent in shape on each cluster. To establish these results we have assembled methods from two distinct areas of mathematics, semi-martingale techniques used for showing stability of Markov chains together with the theory of optimal flows in networks. As corollaries to our main result we obtain the stability classification of the supermarket model under any JLW policy and can explicitly compute the C_k and V_k for any instance of the model and specific JLW policy.',

Further, taking cones, a coarsely excisive functor yields a topologically excisive functor, and for coarse topological spaces there is an associated coarse assembly map from the topologically exicisive functor to the coarsely excisive functor. We conjecture that this coarse assembly map is an isomorphism for uniformly contractible spaces with bounded geometry, and show that the coarse isomorphism conjecture, along with some mild technical conditions, implies that a correspoding equivariant assembly map is injective. Particular instances of this equivariant assembly map are the maps in the Farrell-Jones conjecture, and in the Baum-Connes conjecture.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study inference for high-dimensional data characterized by small sample sizes relative to the dimension of the data. In particular, we provide an infinite-dimensional framework to study statistical models that involve situations in which (i) the number of parameters increase with the sample size (that is, allowed to be random) and (ii) there is a possibility of missing data. Under a variety of tail conditions on the components of the data, we provide precise conditions for the joint consistency of the estimators of the mean. In the process, we clarify and improve some of the recent consistency results that appeared in the literature. An important aspect of the work presented is the development of asymptotic normality results for these models. As a consequence, we construct different test statistics for one-sample and two-sample problems concerning the mean vector and obtain their asymptotic distributions as a corollary of the infinite-dimensional results. Finally, we use these theoretical results to develop an asymptotically justifiable methodology for data analyses. Simulation results presented here describe situations where the methodology can be successfully applied. They also evaluate its robustness under a variety of conditions, some of which are substantially different from the technical conditions. Comparisons to other methods used in the literature are provided. Analyses of real-life data is also included.',

	{'abstract': u'For selfadjoint extensions tilde-A of a symmetric densely defined positive operator A_min, the lower boundedness problem is the question of whether tilde-A is lower bounded an associated operator T in abstract boundary spaces is lower bounded. It holds when the Friedrichs extension A_gamma has compact inverse (Grubb 1974, also Gorbachuk-Mikhailets 1976); this applies to elliptic operators A on bounded domains. For exterior domains, A_gamma ^ is not compact, and whereas the lower bounds satisfy m(T) ge m(tilde-A), the implication of lower boundedness from T to tilde-A has only been known when m(T)&gt;-m(A_gamma). We now show it for general T. The operator A_a corresponding to T=aI, generalizing the Krein-von Neumann extension A_0, appears here; its possible lower boundedness for all real a is decisive. We study this Krein-like extension, showing for bounded domains that the discrete eigenvalues satisfy N_+(t;A_a)=c_At^+O(t^) for t to infty .',

We consider two scenarios. First we consider the compound wiretap model -- group 1 constitutes the set of legitimate receivers, all interested in a common message, whereas group 2 is the set of eavesdroppers. We establish new lower and upper bounds on the secure degrees of freedom. Our lower bound is based on the recently proposed emph scheme. The upper bound provides the first known example which illustrates that the emph used in earlier works is not tight. The second scenario we study is the compound private broadcast channel. Each group is interested in a message that must be protected from the other group. Upper and lower bounds on the degrees of freedom are developed by extending the results on the compound wiretap channel.',

	{'abstract': u'There are several famous unsolved conjectures about the chromatic number that were relaxed and already proven to hold for the fractional chromatic number. We discuss similar relaxations for the topological lower bound(s) of the chromatic number. In particular, we prove that such a relaxed version is true for the Behzad-Vizing conjecture and also discuss the conjectures of Hedetniemi and of Hadwiger from this point of view. For the latter, a similar statement was already proven in an earlier paper of the first author with G. Tardos, our main concern here is that the so-called odd Hadwiger conjecture looks much more difficult in this respect. We prove that the statement of the odd Hadwiger conjecture holds for large enough Kneser graphs and Schrijver graphs of any fixed chromatic number.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, the maximum L-likelihood estimator (MLE), a new parameter estimator based on nonextensive entropy [Kibernetika 3 (1967) 30--35] is introduced. The properties of the MLE are studied via asymptotic analysis and computer simulations. The behavior of the MLE is characterized by the degree of distortion applied to the assumed model. When is properly chosen for small and moderate sample sizes, the MLE can successfully trade bias for precision, resulting in a substantial reduction of the mean squared error. When the sample size is large and tends to 1, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure a proper asymptotic normality and efficiency of MLE is established.',

	{'abstract': u'Convex optimization problems are common in hyperspectral unmixing. Examples include: the constrained least squares (CLS) and the fully constrained least squares (FCLS) problems, which are used to compute the fractional abundances in linear mixtures of known spectra; the constrained basis pursuit (CBP) problem, which is used to find sparse (i.e., with a small number of non-zero terms) linear mixtures of spectra from large libraries; the constrained basis pursuit denoising (CBPDN) problem, which is a generalization of BP that admits modeling errors. In this paper, we introduce two new algorithms to efficiently solve these optimization problems, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, a method from the augmented Lagrangian family. The algorithms are termed SUnSAL (sparse unmixing by variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian) and C-SUnSAL (constrained SUnSAL). C-SUnSAL solves the CBP and CBPDN problems, while SUnSAL solves CLS and FCLS, as well as a more general version thereof, called constrained sparse regression (CSR). C-SUnSAL and SUnSAL are shown to outperform off-the-shelf methods in terms of speed and accuracy.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of estimating the mixing density from i.i.d. observations distributed according to a mixture density with unknown mixing distribution. In contrast with finite mixtures models, here the distribution of the hidden variable is not bounded to a finite set but is spread out over a given interval. An orthogonal series estimator of the mixing density is obtained as follows. An orthonormal sequence is constructed using Legendre polynomials. Then a standard projection estimator is defined, that is, the first coefficients of in this basis are unbiasedly estimated from the observations. The construction of the orthonormal sequence varies from one mixture model to another. Minimax upper and lower bounds of the mean integrated squared error are provided which apply in various contexts. In the specific case of exponential mixtures, it is shown that there exists a constant such that, for , the orthogonal series estimator achieves the minimax rate in a collection of specific smoothness classes, hence, is adaptive over this collection. Other cases are investigated such as Gamma shape mixtures and scale mixtures of compactly supported densities including Beta mixtures.',

	{'abstract': u'Graph invariants provide a powerful analytical tool for investigation of abstract structures of graphs. They, combined in convenient relations, carry global and general information about a graph and its various substructures such as cycle structures, factors, matchings, colorings, coverings, and so on, whose discovery is the primary problem of graph theory. The major goal of this paper is to catalogue all pure relations between basic invariants of a graph and its large cycle structures, namely Hamilton, longest and dominating cycles and some their generalizations. Basic graph invariants and pure relations allow to focus on results having no forerunners. These simplest kind of "ancestors" form a source from which nearly all possible hamiltonian results can be developed further by various additional new ideas, generalizations, extensions, restrictions and structural limitations, as well as helping researchers to make clear and simple imagination about "complicated" developmental mechanisms in the area.',

	{'abstract': u'New trajectory-based small-gain results are obtained for nonlinear feedback systems under relaxed assumptions. Specifically, during a transient period, the solutions of the feedback system may not satisfy some key inequalities that previous small-gain results usually utilize to prove stability properties. The results allow the application of the small-gain perspective to various systems which satisfy less demanding stability notions than the Input-to-Output Stability property. The robust global feedback stabilization problem of an uncertain time-delayed chemostat model is solved by means of the trajectory-based small-gain results.',

	{'abstract': u"A new multivariate concept of quantile, based on a directional version of Koenker and Bassett's traditional regression quantiles, is introduced for multivariate location and multiple-output regression problems. In their empirical version, those quantiles can be computed efficiently via linear programming techniques. Consistency, Bahadur representation and asymptotic normality results are established. Most importantly, the contours generated by those quantiles are shown to coincide with the classical halfspace depth contours associated with the name of Tukey. This relation does not only allow for efficient depth contour computations by means of parametric linear programming, but also for transferring from the quantile to the depth universe such asymptotic results as Bahadur representations. Finally, linear programming duality opens the way to promising developments in depth-related multivariate rank-based inference.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper is concerned with decentralized estimation of a Gaussian source using multiple sensors. We consider a diversity scheme where only the sensor with the best channel sends their measurements over a fading channel to a fusion center, using the analog amplify and forwarding technique. The fusion centre reconstructs an MMSE estimate of the source based on the received measurements. A distributed version of the diversity scheme where sensors decide whether to transmit based only on their local channel information is also considered. We derive asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion (of the MMSE estimate at the fusion centre) of these schemes as the number of sensors becomes large. For comparison, asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion for a coherent multi-access scheme and an orthogonal access scheme are derived. We also study for the diversity schemes, the optimal power allocation for minimizing the expected distortion subject to average total power constraints. The effect of optimizing the probability of transmission on the expected distortion in the distributed scenario is also studied. It is seen that as opposed to the coherent multi-access scheme and the orthogonal scheme (where the expected distortion decays as 1/M, M being the number of sensors), the expected distortion decays only as 1/ln(M) for the diversity schemes. This reduction of the decay rate can be seen as a tradeoff between the simplicity of the diversity schemes and the strict synchronization and large bandwidth requirements for the coherent multi-access and the orthogonal schemes, respectively.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a large-system analysis of the performance of joint channel estimation, multiuser detection, and per-user decoding (CE-MUDD) for randomly-spread multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems. A suboptimal receiver based on successive decoding in conjunction with linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation is investigated. The replica method, developed in statistical mechanics, is used to evaluate the performance in the large-system limit, where the number of users and the spreading factor tend to infinity while their ratio and the number of transmit and receive antennas are kept constant. The performance of the joint CE-MUDD based on LMMSE channel estimation is compared to the spectral efficiencies of several receivers based on one-shot LMMSE channel estimation, in which the decoded data symbols are not utilized to refine the initial channel estimates. The results imply that the use of joint CE-MUDD significantly reduces rate loss due to transmission of pilot signals, especially for multiple-antenna systems. As a result, joint CE-MUDD can provide significant performance gains, compared to the receivers based on one-shot channel estimation.',

	{'abstract': u'Recovery of the sparsity pattern (or support) of an unknown sparse vector from a small number of noisy linear measurements is an important problem in compressed sensing. In this paper, the high-dimensional setting is considered. It is shown that if the measurement rate and per-sample signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are finite constants independent of the length of the vector, then the optimal sparsity pattern estimate will have a constant fraction of errors. Lower bounds on the measurement rate needed to attain a desired fraction of errors are given in terms of the SNR and various key parameters of the unknown vector. The tightness of the bounds in a scaling sense, as a function of the SNR and the fraction of errors, is established by comparison with existing achievable bounds. Near optimality is shown for a wide variety of practically motivated signal models.',

	{'abstract': u'An important theorem about biharmonic submanifolds proved independently by Chen-Ishikawa [CI] and Jiang [Ji] states that an isometric immersion of a surface into 3-dimensional Euclidean space is biharmonic if and only if it is harmonic (i.e, minimal). In a later paper [CMO2], Cadeo-Monttaldo-Oniciuc shown that the theorem remains true if the target Euclidean space is replaced by a 3-dimensional hyperbolic space form. In this paper, we prove the dual results for Riemannian submersions, i.e., a Riemannian submersion from a 3-dimensional space form of non-positive curvature into a surface is biharmonic if and only if it is harmonic.',

	{'abstract': u'Many hard combinatorial problems can be modeled by a system of polynomial equations. N. Alon coined the term polynomial method to describe the use of nonlinear polynomials when solving combinatorial problems. We continue the exploration of the polynomial method and show how the algorithmic theory of polynomial ideals can be used to detect k-colorability, unique Hamiltonicity, and automorphism rigidity of graphs. Our techniques are diverse and involve Nullstellensatz certificates, linear algebra over finite fields, Groebner bases, toric algebra, convex programming, and real algebraic geometry.',

	{'abstract': u"This article critically reappraises arguments in support of Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers. The following results are reported: i) Cantor's proofs of nondenumerability are refuted by analyzing the logical inconsistencies in implementation of the reductio method of proof and by identifying errors. Particular attention is given to the diagonalization argument and to the interpretation of the axiom of infinity. ii) Three constructive proofs have been designed that support the denumerability of the power set of the natural numbers, P(N), thus implying the denumerability of the set of the real numbers R. These results lead to a Theorem of the Continuum that supersedes Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis and establishes the countable nature of the real number line, suggesting that all infinite sets are denumerable. Some immediate implications of denumerability are discussed: i) Valid proofs should not include inconceivable statements, defined as statements that can be found to be false and always lead to contradiction. This is formalized in a Principle of Conceivable Proof. ii) Substantial simplification of the axiomatic principles of set theory can be achieved by excluding transfinite numbers. To facilitate the comparison of sets, infinite as well as finite, the concept of relative cardinality is introduced. iii) Proofs of incompleteness that use diagonal arguments (e.g. those used in Godel's Theorems) are refuted. A constructive proof, based on the denumerability of P(N), is presented to demonstrate the existence of a theory of first-order arithmetic that is consistent, sound, negation-complete, decidable and (assumed p.r. adequate) able to prove its own consistency. Such a result reinstates Hilbert's Programme and brings arithmetic completeness to the forefront of mathematics.",

	{'abstract': u'We propose a model based on the primitive system of the Navier-Stokes equations in a bidimensional framework as the - plane approximation, which allows us to explain the variety of tracks of tropical cyclones (typhoons). Our idea is to construct special analytical solutions with a linear velocity profile for the Navier-Stokes systems. The evidence of the structure of linear velocity near the center of vortex can be proven by the observational data. We study solutions with the linear-velocity property for both barotropic and baroclinic cases and show that they follow the same equations in describing the trajectories of the typhoon eye at the equilibrium state (that relates to the conservative phase of the typhoon dynamics). Moreover, at the equilibrium state, the trajectories can be viewed as a superposition of two circular motions: one has period the other one has period where is the Coriolis parameter and is the height-averaged vorticity at the center of cyclone. Also, we compare our theoretical trajectories based on initial conditions from the flow with tracks obtained from the observational database. It is worth to mention that under certain conditions our results are still compatible with observational data although we did not truly consider the influence of steering effect. %Note that the %motion of the typhoon eye can not be totally determinated by initial %conditions due to the effect of ambient pressure field ("steering" %effect). Finally, we propose the parameter-adopting method so that one could correct the weather prediction in real time. Examples of our analysis and the use of parameter-adopting method for the historic trajectories are provided.',

	{'abstract': u'One main issue, when numerically integrating autonomous Hamiltonian systems, is the long-term conservation of some of its invariants, among which the Hamiltonian function itself. Recently, a new class of methods, named Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods (HBVMs) has been introduced and analysed, which are able to exactly preserve polynomial Hamiltonians of arbitrarily high degree. We here study a further property of such methods, namely that of having, when cast as a Runge-Kutta method, a matrix of the Butcher tableau with the same spectrum (apart from the zero eigenvalues) as that of the corresponding Gauss-Legendre method, independently of the considered abscissae. Consequently, HBVMs are always perfectly A-stable methods. This, in turn, allows to elucidate the existing connections with classical Runge-Kutta collocation methods.',

The smallest number field L where A has all its endomorphisms defined must also have a role. This article deals with the relationship between these two objects in the specific case of modular abelian varieties A_f/Q associated to weight 2 newforms for the modular group Gamma_1(N). Specifically, our goal is to relate the order of L(A_f/Q,s) at s = 1 with Euler products cropped by the set of primes that split completely in L. The results we obtain for the case when f has complex multiplication are complete, while in the absence of CM, our results depend on the rate of convergence in Sato-Tate distributions.',

	{'abstract': u'In the recent past, there has been a concerted effort to develop mathematical models for real-world networks and to analyze various dynamics on these models. One particular problem of significant importance is to understand the effect of random edge lengths or costs on the geometry and flow transporting properties of the network. Two different regimes are of great interest, the weak disorder regime where optimality of a path is determined by the sum of edge weights on the path and the strong disorder regime where optimality of a path is determined by the maximal edge weight on the path. In the context of the stochastic mean-field model of distance, we provide the first mathematically tractable model of weak disorder and show that no transition occurs at finite temperature. Indeed, we show that for every finite temperature, the number of edges on the minimal weight path (i.e., the hopcount) is and satisfies a central limit theorem with asymptotic means and variances of order , with limiting constants expressible in terms of the Malthusian rate of growth and the mean of the stable-age distribution of an associated continuous-time branching process. More precisely, we take independent and identically distributed edge weights with distribution for some parameter , where is an exponential random variable with mean 1. Then the asymptotic mean and variance of the central limit theorem for the hopcount are and , respectively. We also find limiting distributional asymptotics for the value of the minimal weight path in terms of extreme value distributions and martingale limits of branching processes.',

	{'abstract': u'We obtain new connections between permutation patterns and singularities of Schubert varieties, by giving a new characterization of Gorenstein varieties in terms of so called bivincular patterns. These are generalizations of classical patterns where conditions are placed on the location of an occurrence in a permutation, as well as on the values in the occurrence. This clarifies what happens when the requirement of smoothness is weakened to factoriality and further to Gorensteinness, extending work of Bousquet-Melou and Butler (2007), and Woo and Yong (2006). We also show how mesh patterns, introduced by Branden and Claesson (2011), subsume many other types of patterns and define an extension of them called marked mesh patterns. We use these new patterns to further simplify the description of Gorenstein Schubert varieties and give a new description of Schubert varieties that are defined by inclusions, introduced by Gasharov and Reiner (2002). We also give a description of 123-hexagon avoiding permutations, introduced by Billey and Warrington (2001), Dumont permutations and cycles in terms of marked mesh patterns.',

	{'abstract': u'In this article a general framework for studying analytic representations of a real Lie group G is introduced. Fundamental topological properties of the representations are analyzed. A notion of temperedness for analytic representations is introduced, which indicates the existence of an action of a certain natural algebra A(G) of analytic functions of rapid decay. For reductive groups every Harish-Chandra module V is shown to admit a unique tempered analytic globalization, which is generated by V and A(G) and which embeds as the space of analytic vectors in all Banach globalizations of V.',

	{'abstract': u'Measurement error data or errors-in-variable data have been collected in many studies. Natural criterion functions are often unavailable for general functional measurement error models due to the lack of information on the distribution of the unobservable covariates. Typically, the parameter estimation is via solving estimating equations. In addition, the construction of such estimating equations routinely requires solving integral equations, hence the computation is often much more intensive compared with ordinary regression models. Because of these difficulties, traditional best subset variable selection procedures are not applicable, and in the measurement error model context, variable selection remains an unsolved issue. In this paper, we develop a framework for variable selection in measurement error models via penalized estimating equations. We first propose a class of selection procedures for general parametric measurement error models and for general semi-parametric measurement error models, and study the asymptotic properties of the proposed procedures. Then, under certain regularity conditions and with a properly chosen regularization parameter, we demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs as well as an oracle procedure. We assess the finite sample performance via Monte Carlo simulation studies and illustrate the proposed methodology through the empirical analysis of a familiar data set.',

This answers, in this particular case, a general question on Artin-Tits groups, gives a new presentation of an Artin-Tits group of type , and has consequences for the word problem, the computation of some centralizers or the triviality of the center. A key point of the proof is to show that this group is a group of fixed points in an Artin-Tits group of type under an involution. Another important point is the study of the Hurwitz action of the usual braid group on the decomposition of a Coxeter element into a product of reflections.',

	{'abstract': u'Cyclic liftings are proposed to lower the error floor of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The liftings are designed to eliminate dominant trapping sets of the base code by removing the short cycles which form the trapping sets. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the cyclic permutations assigned to the edges of a cycle of length in the base graph such that the inverse image of in the lifted graph consists of only cycles of length strictly larger than . The proposed method is universal in the sense that it can be applied to any LDPC code over any channel and for any iterative decoding algorithm. It also preserves important properties of the base code such as degree distributions, encoder and decoder structure, and in some cases, the code rate. The proposed method is applied to both structured and random codes over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). The error floor improves consistently by increasing the lifting degree, and the results show significant improvements in the error floor compared to the base code, a random code of the same degree distribution and block length, and a random lifting of the same degree. Similar improvements are also observed when the codes designed for the BSC are applied to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.',

	{'abstract': u'We give a new method for calculation of complex and biHermitian structures on low dimensional real Lie algebras. In this method, using non-coordinate basis, we first transform the Nijenhuis tensor field and biHermitian structure relations on Lie groups to the tensor relations on their Lie algebras. Then we use adjoint representation for writing these relations in the matrix form; in this manner by solving these matrix relations and using automorphism groups of four dimensional real Lie algebras we obtain and classify all complex and biHermitian structures on four dimensional real Lie algebras.',

	{'abstract': u'A common belief in high-dimensional data analysis is that data are concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. This motivates simultaneous dimension reduction and regression on manifolds. We provide an algorithm for learning gradients on manifolds for dimension reduction for high-dimensional data with few observations. We obtain generalization error bounds for the gradient estimates and show that the convergence rate depends on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold and not on the dimension of the ambient space. We illustrate the efficacy of this approach empirically on simulated and real data and compare the method to other dimension reduction procedures.',

	{'abstract': u"The study of properties of mean functionals of random probability measures is an important area of research in the theory of Bayesian nonparametric statistics. Many results are now known for random Dirichlet means, but little is known, especially in terms of posterior distributions, for classes of priors beyond the Dirichlet process. In this paper, we consider normalized random measures with independent increments (NRMI's) and mixtures of NRMI. In both cases, we are able to provide exact expressions for the posterior distribution of their means. These general results are then specialized, leading to distributional results for means of two important particular cases of NRMI's and also of the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet process.",

In the first of the three main theorems, we shall show that such a hyperbolic 3-manifold is uniformly bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic to a model manifold which has a structure called brick decomposition and is embedded in . Conversely, any such manifold admitting a brick decomposition with reasonable conditions is bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic to a hyperbolic manifold corresponding to some geometric limit of quasi-Fuchsian groups. Finally, it will be shown that we can define end invariants for hyperbolic 3-manifolds appearing as geometric limits of Kleinian surface groups, and that the homeomorphism type and the end invariants determine the isometric type of a manifold, which is analogous to the ending lamination theorem for the case of finitely generated Kleinian groups.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels with discrete input alphabets. We propose a non-diagonal precoder based on the X-Codes in cite to increase the mutual information. The MIMO channel is transformed into a set of parallel subchannels using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and X-Codes are then used to pair the subchannels. X-Codes are fully characterized by the pairings and a real rotation matrix for each pair (parameterized with a single angle). This precoding structure enables us to express the total mutual information as a sum of the mutual information of all the pairs. The problem of finding the optimal precoder with the above structure, which maximizes the total mutual information, is solved by ) optimizing the rotation angle and the power allocation within each pair and ) finding the optimal pairing and power allocation among the pairs. It is shown that the mutual information achieved with the proposed pairing scheme is very close to that achieved with the optimal precoder by Cruz , and is significantly better than Mercury/waterfilling strategy by Lozano . Our approach greatly simplifies both the precoder optimization and the detection complexity, making it suitable for practical applications.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a new geometric construction of Loewner chains in one and several complex variables which holds on a complete hyperbolic complex manifold M and prove that there is essentially a one-to-one correspondence between evolution families of order d and Loewner chains of the same order. As a consequence we obtain a solution for any Loewner-Kufarev PDE, given by univalent mappings (f_t) from M to a complex manifold N. The problem of finding solutions given by univalent mappings with range in C^n is reduced to investigating whether the union of the images f_t(M) is biholomorphic to a domain in C^n. We apply such results to the study of univalent mappings from the unit ball B^n to C^n.',

	{'abstract': u'Multivariate processes are introduced as a continuous-time models for multidimensional heteroskedastic observations. Our model is driven by a single multivariate L \'vy process and the latent time-varying covariance matrix is directly specified as a stochastic process in the positive semidefinite matrices. After defining the process, we analyze its probabilistic properties. We show a sufficient condition for the existence of a stationary distribution for the stochastic covariance matrix process and present criteria ensuring the finiteness of moments. Under certain natural assumptions on the moments of the driving L \'vy process, explicit expressions for the first and second-order moments and (asymptotic) second-order stationarity of the covariance matrix process are obtained. Furthermore, we study the stationarity and second-order structure of the increments of the multivariate process and their "squares".',

	{'abstract': u'In the design of quantum computing devices of the future the basic element is the qubit. It is a two-level quantum system which may describe population transfer from one steady-state to another controlled by a coherent laser field. A four-dimensional real-variable differential equation model is constructed from the complex-valued two-level model describing the wave function of the system. The state transition matrix of the model is constructed via the Wei-Norman technique and Lie algebraic methodology. The idea of parametrization using flatness-based control, is applied to construct feasible input--output pairs of the model. This input drives the state of the system from the given initial state to the given final state in a finite time producing the corresponding output of the pair. The population transfer is obtained by nullifying part of the state vector via careful selection of the parameter functions. A preliminary simulation study completes the paper.',

As a consequence, we obtain that the fundamental group of M cannot be isomorphic to the fundamental group of any Riemannian manifold of nonpositive sectional curvature.

	{'abstract': u'An isogeny between elliptic curves is an algebraic morphism which is a group homomorphism. Many applications in cryptography require evaluating large degree isogenies between elliptic curves efficiently. For ordinary curves of the same endomorphism ring, the previous best known algorithm has a worst case running time which is exponential in the length of the input. In this paper we show this problem can be solved in subexponential time under reasonable heuristics. Our approach is based on factoring the ideal corresponding to the kernel of the isogeny, modulo principal ideals, into a product of smaller prime ideals for which the isogenies can be computed directly. Combined with previous work of Bostan et al., our algorithm yields equations for large degree isogenies in quasi-optimal time given only the starting curve and the kernel.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper considers the problem of estimating the channel response (or Green's function) between multiple source-receiver pairs. Typically, the channel responses are estimated one-at-a-time: a single source sends out a known probe signal, the receiver measures the probe signal convolved with the channel response, and the responses are recovered using deconvolution. In this paper, we show that if the channel responses are sparse and the probe signals are random, then we can significantly reduce the total amount of time required to probe the channels by activating all of the sources simultaneously. With all sources activated simultaneously, the receiver measures a superposition of all the channel responses convolved with the respective probe signals. Separating this cumulative response into individual channel responses can be posed as a linear inverse problem. We show that channel response separation is possible (and stable) even when the probing signals are relatively short in spite of the corresponding linear system of equations becoming severely underdetermined. We derive a theoretical lower bound on the length of the source signals that guarantees that this separation is possible with high probability. The bound is derived by putting the problem in the context of finding a sparse solution to an underdetermined system of equations, and then using mathematical tools from the theory of compressive sensing. Finally, we discuss some practical applications of these results, which include forward modeling for seismic imaging, channel equalization in multiple-input multiple-output communication, and increasing the field-of-view in an imaging system by using coded apertures.",

We consider Hamiltonians with any finite number of bounded operators and also a certain class of unbounded operators. We obtain bounds and propagation speeds for quantum systems on lattices and also general graphs possessing a kind of homogeneity and isotropy. One area for which this formalism could be useful is the study of quantum phase transitions which occur when interactions strengths are varied.',

By the recently proved Razumov--Stroganov conjecture, these quantities also appear as groundstate components in the Completely Packed Loop model. When considering matchings with p nested arches, these numbers are known to be polynomials in p. In this article, we present several conjectures about these polynomials: in particular, we describe all real roots, certain values of these polynomials, and conjecture that the coefficients are positive. The conjectures, which are of a combinatorial nature, are supported by strong numerical evidence and the proofs of several special cases.

The absolutely continuous part of the latter allows for an analytic continuation, the singularities of which give rise to resonances.

	{'abstract': u'Occupation time fluctuation limits of particle systems in R^d with independent motions (symmetric stable Levy process, with or without critical branching) have been studied assuming initial distributions given by Poisson random measures (homogeneous and some inhomogeneous cases). In this paper, with d=1 for simplicity, we extend previous results to a wide class of initial measures obeying a quasi-homogeneity property, which includes as special cases homogeneous Poisson measures and many deterministic measures (simple example: one atom at each point of Z), by means of a new unified approach. In previous papers, in the homogeneous Poisson case, for the branching system in "low" dimensions, the limit was characterized by a long-range dependent Gaussian process called sub-fractional Brownian motion (sub-fBm), and this effect was attributed to the branching because it had appeared only in that case. An unexpected finding in this paper is that sub-fBm is more prevalent than previously thought. Namely, it is a natural ingredient of the limit process in the non-branching case (for "low" dimension), as well. On the other hand, fractional Brownian motion is not only related to systems in equilibrium (e.g., non-branching system with initial homogeneous Poisson measure), but it also appears here for a wider class of initial measures of quasi-homogeneous type.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the interaction of saddle-node and transcritical bifurcations in a Lotka-Volterra model with a constant term representing harvesting or migration. Because some of the equilibria of the model lie on an invariant coordinate axis, both the saddle-node and the transcritical bifurcations are of codimension one. Their interaction can be associated with either a single or a double zero eigenvalue. We show that in the former case, the local bifurcation diagram is given by a nonversal unfolding of the cusp bifurcation whereas in the latter case it is a nonversal unfolding of a degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. We present a simple model for each of the two cases to illustrate the possible unfoldings. We analyse the consequences of the generic phase portraits for the Lotka-Volterra system.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we give an effective criterion as to when a prime number p is the order of an automorphism of a smooth cubic hypersurface of P^, for a fixed n &gt; 1. We also provide a computational method to classify all such hypersurfaces that admit an automorphism of prime order p. In particular, we show that p&lt;2^ and that any such hypersurface admitting an automorphism of order p&gt;2^n is isomorphic to the Klein n-fold. We apply our method to compute exhaustive lists of automorphism of prime order of smooth cubic threefolds and fourfolds. Finally, we provide an application to the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties.',

Garcia-Sanchez, together with several co-authors, derived a method to calculate the catenary and tame degree from the monoid of relations, and they applied this method successfully in the case of numerical monoids.

Suboptimal minimax state estimation algorithm is introduced for DAEs with non-stationary rectangular matrices. Optimal algorithm is presented for DAEs with special structure of the matrices. A comparison of suboptimal and optimal algorithms is presented for 2D time-varying DAE with a singular matrix pencil.',

The ternary Virasoro-Witt algebras constructed by Curtright, Fairlie and Zachos depend on a parameter and are not Nambu-Lie algebras for all but finitely many values of this parameter. For the parameter values for which the ternary Virasoro-Witt algebras are Nambu-Lie, the corresponding ternary -Virasoro-Witt algebras constructed in this article are also Hom-Nambu-Lie because they are obtained from the ternary Nambu-Lie algebras using the composition method. For other parameter values this composition method does not yield Hom-Nambu Lie algebra structure for -Virasoro-Witt algebras. We show however, using a different construction, that the ternary Virasoro-Witt algebras of Curtright, Fairlie and Zachos, as well as the general ternary -Virasoro-Witt algebras we construct, carry a structure of ternary Hom-Nambu-Lie algebra for all values of the involved parameters.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper a construction of affine exterior algebra of Grassmann, with a special attention to the revisitation of this subject operated by Peano and his School, is examined from a historical viewpoint. Even if the exterior algebra over a vector space is a well known concept, the construction of an exterior algebra over an affine space, in which points and vectors coexist, has been neglected. This paper wants to fill this lack. Some attention is given to the introduction of defining by abstraction (today called definition by quotienting or by equivalence relation), a procedure due to and used by Peano to define geometric forms, basic elements of an affine exterior algebra. This Peano's innovative way of defining, is a relevant contribution to mathematics. It is observed that in the construction of an affine exterior algebra on the Euclidean three-dimensional space, Grassmann and Peano make use of metric concepts: an accurate analysis shows that, in some cases, the metric aspects can be eliminated, putting into evidence the sufficiency of the underlying affine structure of the Euclidean space. In the final part of the paper some geometrical and mechanical applications and interpretations of the affine exterior algebra given by Grassmann and Peano are presented.",

	{'abstract': u'A detailed study of various distinguished limits of the Green-Kubo formula for the self-diffusion coefficient is presented in this paper. First, an alternative representation of the Green-Kubo formula in terms of the solution of a Poisson equation is derived when the microscopic dynamics is Markovian. Then, the techniques developed in cite are used to obtain a Stieltjes integral representation formula for the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the diffusion tensor. The effect of irreversible microscopic dynamics on the diffusion coefficient is analyzed and various asymptotic limits of physical interest are studied. Several examples are presented that confirm the findings of our theory.',

	{'abstract': u'By retracing research on coexistent magnitudes (grandeurs coexistantes) by Cauchy (1841), Peano in "Applicazioni geometriche del calcolo infinitesimale" (1887) defines the "density" (strict derivative) of a "mass" (a distributive set function) with respect to a "volume" (a positive distributive set function), proves its continuity (whenever the strict derivative exists) and shows the validity of the mass-density paradigm: "mass" is recovered from "density" by integration with respect to "volume". It is remarkable that Peano\'s strict derivative provides a consistent mathematical ground to the concept of "infinitesimal ratio" between two magnitudes, successfully used since Kepler. In this way the classical (i.e., pre-Lebesgue) measure theory reaches a complete and definitive form in Peano\'s Applicazioni geometriche. A primary aim of the present paper is a detailed exposition of Peano\'s work of 1887 leading to the concept of strict derivative of distributive set functions and their use. Moreover, we compare Peano\'s work and Lebesgue\'s "La mesure des grandeurs" (1935): in this memoir Lebesgue, motivated by coexistent magnitudes of Cauchy, introduces a uniform-derivative of certain additive set functions, a concept that coincides with Peano\'s strict derivative. Intriguing questions are whether Lebesgue was aware of the contributions of Peano and which role is played by the notions of strict derivative or of uniform-derivative in today mathematical practice.',

This conjecture, together with hundreds of similar identities, were derived automatically and proved rigorously by Zeilberger via his powerful program and WZ method. It appears that each one is a linear combination of Motzkin numbers with constant coefficients. In this paper we will introduce a simple bijection between Motzkin paths and standard Young tableaux with at most three rows.

	{'abstract': u'The causal Markov condition (CMC) is a postulate that links observations to causality. It describes the conditional independences among the observations that are entailed by a causal hypothesis in terms of a directed acyclic graph. In the conventional setting, the observations are random variables and the independence is a statistical one, i.e., the information content of observations is measured in terms of Shannon entropy. We formulate a generalized CMC for any kind of observations on which independence is defined via an arbitrary submodular information measure. Recently, this has been discussed for observations in terms of binary strings where information is understood in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity. Our approach enables us to find computable alternatives to Kolmogorov complexity, e.g., the length of a text after applying existing data compression schemes. We show that our CMC is justified if one restricts the attention to a class of causal mechanisms that is adapted to the respective information measure. Our justification is similar to deriving the statistical CMC from functional models of causality, where every variable is a deterministic function of its observed causes and an unobserved noise term. Our experiments on real data demonstrate the performance of compression based causal inference.',

Such an algorithm is obtained from BRAIN by introducing fuzzy sets in order to manage uncertainty. In the case where no missing bits are present, the algorithm reduces to the original BRAIN.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose a semiring-theoretic approach to MV-algebras based on the connection between such algebras and idempotent semirings - such an approach naturally imposing the introduction and study of a suitable corresponding class of semimodules, called MV-semimodules. We present several results addressed toward a semiring theory for MV-algebras. In particular we show a representation of MV-algebras as a subsemiring of the endomorphism semiring of a semilattice, the construction of the Grothendieck group of a semiring and its functorial nature, and the effect of Mundici categorical equivalence between MV-algebras and lattice-ordered Abelian groups with a distinguished strong order unit upon the relationship between MV-semimodules and semimodules over idempotent semifields.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study entanglement of the reduced density matrix of a bipartite quantum system in a random pure state. It transpires that this involves the computation of the smallest eigenvalue distribution of the fixed trace Laguerre ensemble of random matrices. We showed that for finite the smallest eigenvalue distribution may be expressed in terms of Jack polynomials. Furthermore, based on the exact results, we found, a limiting distribution, when the smallest eigenvalue is suitably scaled with followed by a large limit. Our results turn out to be the same as the smallest eigenvalue distribution of the classical Laguerre ensembles without the fixed trace constraint. This suggests in a broad sense, the global constraint does not influence local correlations, at least, in the large limit. Consequently, we have solved an open problem: The determination of the smallest eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density matrix---obtained by tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom---for a bipartite quantum system of unequal dimensions.',

If a GL(2, R) structure arises on a moduli space of rational curves on a surface with self-intersection number 6, then certain components of the intrinsic torsion of the G_2 structure vanish. We give examples of simple 7th order ODEs whose solution curves are rational and find the corresponding G_2 structures.

	{'abstract': u'A class of ultrametric Cantor sets introduced recently in literature (Raut, S and Datta, D P (2009), Fractals, 17, 45-52) is shown to enjoy some novel properties. The ultrametric is defined using the concept of and an rule. The associated (infinitesimal) valuation which turns out to be both scale and reparametrisation invariant, is identified with the Cantor function associated with a Cantor set where the relative infinitesimals are supposed to live in. These ultrametrics are both metrically as well as topologically inequivalent compared to the topology induced by the usual metric. Every point of the original Cantor set is identified with the closure of the set of gaps of . The increments on such an ultrametric space is accomplished by following the inversion rule. As a consequence, Cantor functions are reinterpretd as (every where) locally constant on these extended ultrametric spaces. An interesting phenomenon, called , is studied on such an ultrametric space. Using the reparametrisation invariance of the valuation it is shown how the scale factors of a Lebesgue measure zero Cantor set might get leading to a Cantor set with a positive measure. The definition of a new is introduced which is shown to yield the fatness exponent in the case of a positive measure (fat) Cantor set. However, the valuated exponent can also be used to distinguish Cantor sets with identical Hausdorff dimension and thickness. A class of Cantor sets with Hausdorff dimension and thickness 1 are constructed explicitly.',

	{'abstract': u'In the spirit of the work of Grothendieck, we introduce and study natural symmetric n-fold tensor norms. We prove that there are exactly six natural symmetric tensor norms for , a noteworthy difference with the 2-fold case in which there are four. We also describe the polynomial ideals associated to these natural symmetric tensor norms. Using a symmetric version of a result of Carne, we establish which natural symmetric tensor norms preserve Banach algebras.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) performance at a mobile station (MS) in a random cellular network. The cellular network is formed by base-stations (BSs) placed in a one, two or three dimensional space according to a possibly non-homogeneous Poisson point process, which is a generalization of the so-called shotgun cellular system. We develop a sequence of equivalence relations for the SCSs and use them to derive semi-analytical expressions for the coverage probability at the MS when the transmissions from each BS may be affected by random fading with arbitrary distributions as well as attenuation following arbitrary path-loss models. For homogeneous Poisson point processes in the interference-limited case with power-law path-loss model, we show that the SINR distribution is the same for all fading distributions and is not a function of the base station density. In addition, the influence of random transmission powers, power control, multiple channel reuse groups on the downlink performance are also discussed. The techniques developed for the analysis of SINR have applications beyond cellular networks and can be used in similar studies for cognitive radio networks, femtocell networks and other heterogeneous and multi-tier networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a system with N unit-service-rate queues in tandem, with exogenous arrivals of rate lambda at queue 1, under a back-pressure (MaxWeight) algorithm: service at queue n is blocked unless its queue length is greater than that of next queue n+1. The question addressed is how steady-state queues scale as N goes to infinity. We show that the answer depends on whether lambda is below or above the critical value 1/4: in the former case queues remain uniformly stochastically bounded, while otherwise they grow to infinity. The problem is essentially reduced to the behavior of the system with infinite number of queues in tandem, which is studied using tools from interacting particle systems theory. In particular, the criticality of load 1/4 is closely related to the fact that this is the maximum possible flux (flow rate) of a stationary totally asymmetric simple exclusion process.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper studies an interference interaction (game) between selfish and independent wireless communication systems in the same frequency band. Each system (player) has incomplete information about the other player's channel conditions. A trivial Nash equilibrium point in this game is where players mutually full spread (FS) their transmit spectrum and interfere with each other. This point may lead to poor spectrum utilization from a global network point of view and even for each user individually. In this paper, we provide a closed form expression for a non pure-FS epsilon-Nash equilibrium point; i.e., an equilibrium point where players choose FDM for some channel realizations and FS for the others. We show that operating in this non pure-FS epsilon-Nash equilibrium point increases each user's throughput and therefore improves the spectrum utilization, and demonstrate that this performance gain can be substantial. Finally, important insights are provided into the behaviour of selfish and rational wireless users as a function of the channel parameters such as fading probabilities, the interference-to-signal ratio.",

	{'abstract': u'Rough speaking, information theory deals with data transmitted over a channel such as the internet. Modern information theory is generally considered to have been founded in 1948 by Shannon in his seminal paper, "A mathematical theory of communication." Shannon\'s formulation of information theory was an immediate success with communications engineers. Shannon defined mathematically the amount of information transmitted over a channel. The amount of information doesn\'t mean the number of symbols of data. It depends on occurrence probabilities of symbols of the data. Meanwhile, psychophysics is the study of quantitative relations between psychological events and physical events or, more specifically, between sensations and the stimuli that produce them. It seems that Shannon\'s information theory bears no relation to psychophysics established by German scientist and philosopher Fechner. Here I show that to our astonishment it is possible to combine two fields. And therefore we come to be capable of measuring mathematically perceptions of the physical stimuli applicable to the Weber-Fechner law. I will define the concept of new entropy. And as a consequence of this, new field will begin life.',

	{'abstract': u'A drawing of a graph in the plane is called a thrackle if every pair of edges meets precisely once, either at a common vertex or at a proper crossing. Let t(n) denote the maximum number of edges that a thrackle of n vertices can have. According to a 40 years old conjecture of Conway, t(n)=n for every n&gt;2. For any eps&gt;0, we give an algorithm terminating in e^ steps to decide whether t(n)&lt;(1+eps)n for all n&gt;2. Using this approach, we improve the best known upper bound, t(n)&lt;=3/2(n-1), due to Cairns and Nikolayevsky, to 167/117n&lt;1.428n.',

	{'abstract': u"We obtain an explicit simple formula for the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion for the factorial of a natural number,in terms of derivatives of powers of an elementary function. The unique explicit expression for the coefficients that appears to be known is that in the book by L. Comtet, which is given in terms of sums of associated Stirling numbers of the first kind. By considering the bivariate generating function of the associated Stirling numbers of the second kind, another expression for the coefficients in terms of them follows also from our analysis. Comparison with Comtet's expression yields combinatorial identities between associated Stirling numbers of first and second kind. It suggests by analogy another possible formula for the coefficients, in terms of a function involving the logarithm, that in fact proves to be true. The resulting coefficients, as well as the first ones are identified via the Lagrange inversion formula as the odd coefficients of the inverse of a pair of formal series, which permits us to obtain also some recurrences.",

We also introduce quasi-multipliers for bimodules in Kasparov's sense and even for Banach bimodules over C*-algebras, provided these C*-algebras act non-degenerately. A topological picture of quasi-multipliers via the quasi-strict topology is given.

The critical probability p_c is the smallest p for which the probability that the entire square is eventually infected exceeds 1/2. Holroyd determined the sharp first-order approximation: p_c sim pi^2/(18 log n) as n to infty.

A quantity arising in the analysis of phylogenetic trees is also proved to have a similar asymptotic expansion. Our method of proof is new in the literature of discrete probability and analysis of algorithms, and based on the psi-series expansions for nonlinear differential equations. Such an approach is very general and applicable to many other problems involving nonlinear differential equations; many examples are discussed and several attractive phenomena are discovered.',

	{'abstract': u'New necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the quantization of a class of periodic second order non-homogeneous ordinary differential equations in the complex plane in this paper. The problem is studied from the viewpoint of complex oscillation theory first developed by Bank and Laine (1982, 1983) and Gundersen and Steinbart (1994). We show that when a solution is complex non-oscillatory (finite exponent of convergence of zeros) then the solution, which can be written as special functions, must degenerate. This gives a necessary and sufficient condition when the Lommel function has finitely many zeros in every branch and this is a type of quantization for the non-homogeneous differential equation. The degenerate solutions are of polynomial/rational-type functions which are of independent interest. In particular, this shows that complex non-oscillatory solutions of this class of differential equations are equivalent to the subnormal solutions considered in a previous paper of the authors (to appear). In addition to the asymptotics of special functions, the other main idea we apply in our proof is a classical result of E. M. Wright which gives precise asymptotic locations of large zeros of a functional equation.',

	{'abstract': u'A basic problem of interest in connection with the study of Schauder frames in Banach spaces is that of characterizing those Schauder frames which can essentially be regarded as Schauder bases. In this paper, we give a solution to this problem using the notion of the minimal-associated sequence spaces and the minimal-associated reconstruction operators for Schauder frames. We prove that a Schauder frame is a near-Schauder basis if and only if the kernel of the minimal-associated reconstruction operator contains no copy of . In particular, a Schauder frame of a Banach space with no copy of is a near-Schauder basis if and only if the minimal-associated sequence space contains no copy of . In these cases, the minimal-associated reconstruction operator has a finite dimensional kernel and the dimension of the kernel is exactly the excess of the near-Schauder basis. Using these results, we make related applications on Besselian frames and near-Riesz bases.',

	{'abstract': u'Stochastic point processes with refractoriness appear frequently in the quantitative analysis of physical and biological systems, such as the generation of action potentials by nerve cells, the release and reuptake of vesicles at a synapse, and the counting of particles by detector devices. Here we present an extension of renewal theory to describe ensembles of point processes with time varying input. This is made possible by a representation in terms of occupation numbers of two states: Active and refractory. The dynamics of these occupation numbers follows a distributed delay differential equation. In particular, our theory enables us to uncover the effect of refractoriness on the time-dependent rate of an ensemble of encoding point processes in response to modulation of the input. We present exact solutions that demonstrate generic features, such as stochastic transients and oscillations in the step response as well as resonances, phase jumps and frequency doubling in the transfer of periodic signals. We show that a large class of renewal processes can indeed be regarded as special cases of the model we analyze. Hence our approach represents a widely applicable framework to define and analyze non-stationary renewal processes.',

	{'abstract': u"We show a surprising link between singularity theory and the invariant subspace problem of nilpotent operators as recently studied by C. M. Ringel and M. Schmidmeier, a problem with a longstanding history going back to G. Birkhoff. The link is established via weighted projective lines and (stable) categories of vector bundles on those. The setup yields a new approach to attack the subspace problem. In particular, we deduce the main results of Ringel and Schmidmeier for nilpotency degree p from properties of the category of vector bundles on the weighted projective line of weight type (2,3,p), obtained by Serre construction from the triangle singularity x^2+y^3+z^p. For p=6 the Ringel-Schmidmeier classification is thus covered by the classification of vector bundles for tubular type (2,3,6), and then is closely related to Atiyah's classification of vector bundles on a smooth elliptic curve. Returning to the general case, we establish that the stable categories associated to vector bundles or invariant subspaces of nilpotent operators may be naturally identified as triangulated categories. They satisfy Serre duality and also have tilting objects whose endomorphism rings play a role in singularity theory. In fact, we thus obtain a whole sequence of triangulated (fractional) Calabi-Yau categories, indexed by p, which naturally form an ADE-chain.",

	{'abstract': u'Let G be a group and let A be the algebra of complex functions on G with finite support. The product in G gives rise to a coproduct on A making it a multiplier Hopf algebra. In fact, because there exist integrals, we get an algebraic quantum group. Now let H be a finite subgroup of G and consider the subalgebra of functions in A that are constant on double cosets of H. The coproduct in general will not leave this algebra invariant but we can modify it so that it will leave the subalgebra invariant (in the sense that the image is in the multiplier algebra of the tensor product of this subalgebra with itself). However, the modified coproduct on the subalgebra will no longer be an algebra map. So, in general we do not have an algebraic quantum group but a so-called algebraic quantum hypergroup. Group-like projections in a *-algebraic quantum group A give rise, in a natural way, to *-algebraic quantum hypergroups, very much like subgroups do as above for a *-algebraic quantum group associated to a group. In this paper we push this result further. On the one hand, we no longer assume the *-structure while on the other hand, we allow the group-like projection to belong to the multiplier algebra M(A) of A and not only to A itself. Doing so, we not only get some well-known earlier examples of algebraic quantum hypergroups but also some interesting new ones.',

If this invariant is zero, the two tangents are said to be conjugate. When the two tangents coincide with a given tangent, then we obtain the normal curvature of this tangent. Asymptotic tangents (curves) are characterized by zero normal curvature. Considering the invariant of the pair of a given tangent and its orthogonal one, we introduce the geodesic torsion of this tangent. We obtain that principal tangents (curves) are characterized by zero geodesic torsion. The invariants and are introduced as the symmetric functions of the two principal normal curvatures. The geometric meaning of the semi-sum of the principal normal curvatures is equal (up to a sign) to the curvature of the normal connection of the surface. The number of asymptotic tangents at a point of the surface is determined by the sign of the invariant . In the case there exists a one-parameter family of asymptotic lines, which are principal.

Several new types of regularity conditions are introduced, such as a one in which a complex exponent of the unknown function is locally measurable. An initial value approach to treating this equation is considered too. The analysis is extended to related equations such as the Jensen equation, the multiplicative Cauchy equation, and the Pexider equation.

	{'abstract': u'Let X be a complex manifold fibered over the base S and let L be a relatively ample line bundle over X. We define relative Kahler-Ricci flows on the space of all Hermitian metrics on L with relatively positive curvature. Mainly three different settings are investigated: the case when the fibers are Calabi-Yau manifolds and the case when L is the relative (anti-) canonical line bundle. The main theme studied is whether posivity in families is preserved under the flows and its relation to the variation of the moduli of the complex structures of the fibres. The quantization of this setting is also studied, where the role of the Kahler-Ricci flow is played by Donaldson\'s iteration on the space of all Hermitian metrics on the finite rank vector bundle over S defined as the zeroth direct image induced by the fibration. Applications to the construction of canonical metrics on relative canonical bumdles and Weil-Petersson geometry are given. Some of the main results are a parabolic analogue of a recent elliptic equation of Schumacher and the convergence towards the K "ahler-Ricci flow of Donaldson\'s iteration in a certain double scaling limit.',

For a given , we consider, for every , a random quadrangulation uniformly distributed over the set of all rooted bipartite quadrangulations of genus with faces. We view it as a metric space by endowing its set of vertices with the graph distance. We show that, as tends to infinity, this metric space, with distances rescaled by the factor , converges in distribution, at least along some subsequence, toward a limiting random metric space. This convergence holds in the sense of the Gromov-Hausdorff topology on compact metric spaces. We show that, regardless of the choice of the subsequence, the Hausdorff dimension of the limiting space is almost surely equal to 4. Our main tool is a bijection introduced by Chapuy, Marcus, and Schaeffer between the quadrangulations we consider and objects they call well-labeled -trees.

Our main result, a categorification of the geometric description of cyclic homology, relates S^1-equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on the loop space of a smooth scheme or geometric stack X in characteristic zero with sheaves on X with flat connection, or equivalently D_X-modules. By deducing the Hodge filtration on de Rham modules from the formality of cochains on the circle, we are able to recover D_X-modules precisely rather than a periodic version. More generally, we consider the rotated Hopf fibration Omega S^3 --&gt; Omega S^2 --&gt; S^1, and relate Omega S^2-equivariant sheaves on the loop space with sheaves on X with arbitrary connection, with curvature given by their Omega S^3-equivariance.',

	{'abstract': u'Given two maps f1 and f2 from the sphere Sm to an n-manifold N, when are they loose, i.e. when can they be deformed away from one another? We study the geometry of their (generic) coincidence locus and its Nielsen decomposition. On the one hand the resulting bordism class of coincidence data and the corresponding Nielsen numbers are strong looseness obstructions. On the other hand the values which these invariants may possibly assume turn out to satisfy severe restrictions, e.g. the Nielsen numbers can only take the values 0, 1 or the cardinality of the fundamental group of N. In order to show this we compare different Nielsen classes in the root case (where f1 or f2 is constant) and we use the fact that all but possibly one Nielsen class are inessential in the selfcoincidence case (where f1 = f2). Also we deduce strong vanishing results.',

It is shown that many results well known for compact sets can be generalized to -compact sets. Several examples are considered. The main result of the paper is a generalization to -compact convex sets of the Vesterstrom-O'Brien theorem showing equivalence of the particular properties of a compact convex set (s.t. openness of the mixture map, openness of the barycenter map and of its restriction to maximal measures, continuity of a convex hull of any continuous function, continuity of a convex hull of any concave continuous function). It is shown that the Vesterstrom-O'Brien theorem does not hold for pointwise -compact convex sets defined by the slight relaxing of the -compactness condition.

	{'abstract': u'A zone diagram is a relatively new concept which has emerged in computational geometry and is related to Voronoi diagrams. Formally, it is a fixed point of a certain mapping, and neither its uniqueness nor its existence are obvious in advance. It has been studied by several authors, starting with T. Asano, J. Matousek and T. Tokuyama, who considered the Euclidean plane with singleton sites, and proved the existence and uniqueness of zone diagrams there. In the present paper we prove the existence of zone diagrams with respect to finitely many pairwise disjoint compact sites contained in a compact and convex subset of a uniformly convex normed space, provided that either the sites or the convex subset satisfy a certain mild condition. The proof is based on the Schauder fixed point theorem, the Curtis-Schori theorem regarding the Hilbert cube, and on recent results concerning the characterization of Voronoi cells as a collection of line segments and their geometric stability with respect to small changes of the corresponding sites. Along the way we obtain the continuity of the Dom mapping as well as interesting and apparently new properties of Voronoi cells.',

	{'abstract': u'This is an investigation of the role of shuffling and concatenating in the theory of graph drawing. A simple syntactic description of these and related operations is proved complete in the context of finite partial orders, as general as possible. An explanation based on that is given for a previously investigated collapse of the permutohedron into the associahedron, and for collapses into other less familiar polyhedra, including the cyclohedron. Such polyhedra have been considered recently in connection with the notion of tubing, which is closely related to tree-like finite partial orders defined simply and investigated here in detail. Like the associahedron, some of these other polyhedra are involved in categorial coherence questions, which will be treated in a sequel to this paper.

	{'abstract': u"An 'etale homotopy type associated to any pointed locally fibrant connected simplicial sheaf on a pointed locally connected small Grothendieck site is studied. It is shown that this type specializes to the 'etale homotopy type of Artin-Mazur for pointed connected schemes , that it is invariant up to pro-isomorphism under pointed local weak equivalences (but see cite for an earlier proof), and that it recovers abelian and nonabelian sheaf cohomology of with constant coefficients. This type is compared to the 'etale homotopy type constructed by means of diagonals of pointed bisimplicial hypercovers of in terms of the associated categories of cocycles, and it is shown that there are bijections pi_0 H_(x, y) cong pi_0 H_(x, y) at the level of path components for any locally fibrant target object . This quickly leads to natural pro-isomorphisms in . By consequence one immediately establishes the fact that is invariant up to pro-isomorphism under pointed local weak equivalences. Analogous statements for the unpointed versions of these types also follow.",

	{'abstract': u'A local lattice point counting formula, and more generally a local Euler-Maclaurin formula follow by comparing two natural families of meromorphic functions on the dual of a rational vector space , namely the family of exponential sums (S) and the family of exponential integrals (I) parametrized by the set of rational polytopes in . The paper introduces the notion of an interpolator between these two families of meromorphic functions. We prove that every rigid complement map in gives rise to an effectively computable SI-interpolator (and a local Euler-MacLaurin formula), an IS-interpolator (and a reverse local Euler-MacLaurin formula) and an ISo-interpolator. Rigid complement maps can be constructed by choosing an inner product on or by choosing a complete flag in . The corresponding interpolators generalize and unify the work of Berline-Vergne, Pommersheim-Thomas, and Morelli.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, Arkan introduced the method of channel polarization on which one can construct efficient capacity-achieving codes, called polar codes, for any binary discrete memoryless channel. In the thesis, we show that decoding algorithm of polar codes, called successive cancellation decoding, can be regarded as belief propagation decoding, which has been used for decoding of low-density parity-check codes, on a tree graph. On the basis of the observation, we show an efficient construction method of polar codes using density evolution, which has been used for evaluation of the error probability of belief propagation decoding on a tree graph. We further show that channel polarization phenomenon and polar codes can be generalized to non-binary discrete memoryless channels. Asymptotic performances of non-binary polar codes, which use non-binary matrices called the Reed-Solomon matrices, are better than asymptotic performances of the best explicitly known binary polar code. We also find that the Reed-Solomon matrices are considered to be natural generalization of the original binary channel polarization introduced by Arkan.',

When the group defining the Shimura variety ramifies at p, the local models (and hence the Shimura models) as originally defined can fail to be flat, and it becomes desirable to modify their definition so as to obtain a flat scheme. In the case of unitary similitude groups whose localizations at Q_p are ramified, quasi-split GU_n, Pappas and Rapoport have added new conditions, the so-called wedge and spin conditions, to the moduli problem defining the original local models and conjectured that their new local models are flat. We prove a preliminary form of their conjecture, namely that their new models are topologically flat, in the case n is odd.",

	{'abstract': u'Broadcasting algorithms are important building blocks of distributed systems. In this work we investigate the typical performance of the classical and well-studied push model. Assume that initially one node in a given network holds some piece of information. In each round, every one of the informed nodes chooses independently a neighbor uniformly at random and transmits the message to it. In this paper we consider random networks where each vertex has degree d, which is at least 3, i.e., the underlying graph is drawn uniformly at random from the set of all d-regular graphs with n vertices. We show that with probability 1 - o(1) the push model broadcasts the message to all nodes within (1 + o(1))C_d ln n rounds, where C_d = 1/ ln(2(1-1/d)) - 1/(d ln(1 - 1/d)). In particular, we can characterize precisely the effect of the node degree to the typical broadcast time of the push model. Moreover, we consider pseudo-random regular networks, where we assume that the degree of each node is very large. There we show that the broadcast time is (1+o(1))C ln n with probability 1 - o(1), where C= 1/ ln 2 + 1, is the limit of C_d as d grows.',

In an HMM, the underlying Markov chain is usually hidden and the Viterbi alignment is often used as the estimate of it. This approach will be referred to as the Viterbi segmentation. The goodness of the Viterbi segmentation can be measured by several risks. In this paper, we prove the existence of asymptotic risks. Being independent of data, the asymptotic risks can be considered as the characteristics of the model that illustrate the long-run behavior of the Viterbi segmentation.',

	{'abstract': u'Within a Bayesian decision theoretic framework we investigate some asymptotic optimality properties of a large class of multiple testing rules. A parametric setup is considered, in which observations come from a normal scale mixture model and the total loss is assumed to be the sum of losses for individual tests. Our model can be used for testing point null hypotheses, as well as to distinguish large signals from a multitude of very small effects. A rule is defined to be asymptotically Bayes optimal under sparsity (ABOS), if within our chosen asymptotic framework the ratio of its Bayes risk and that of the Bayes oracle (a rule which minimizes the Bayes risk) converges to one. Our main interest is in the asymptotic scheme where the proportion p of "true" alternatives converges to zero. We fully characterize the class of fixed threshold multiple testing rules which are ABOS, and hence derive conditions for the asymptotic optimality of rules controlling the Bayesian False Discovery Rate (BFDR). We finally provide conditions under which the popular Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) and Bonferroni procedures are ABOS and show that for a wide class of sparsity levels, the threshold of the former can be approximated by a nonrandom threshold.',

The manifold D_4 can be mapped one-to-one onto the future tube domain C^4_+ of the complex Minkowski space through a Cayley transformation, where other kind of (electromagnetic) wavelets have already been proposed in the literature. We study the unitary irreducible representations of the conformal group on the Hilbert spaces L^2_h(D_4,d nu_ lambda) and L^2_h(C^4_+,d tilde nu_ lambda) of square integrable holomorphic functions with scale dimension lambda and continuous mass spectrum, prove the isomorphism (equivariance) between both Hilbert spaces, admissibility and tight-frame conditions, provide reconstruction formulas and orthonormal basis of homogeneous polynomials and discuss symmetry properties and the Euclidean limit of the proposed conformal wavelets. For that purpose, we firstly state and prove a lambda-extension of Schwinger's Master Theorem (SMT), which turns out to be a useful mathematical tool for us, particularly as a generating function for the unitary-representation functions of the conformal group and for the derivation of the reproducing (Bergman) kernel of L^2_h(D_4,d nu_ lambda).

Moreover, using a slow decorrelation phenomena, the results are extended from fixed time to the whole space-time, except along the some directions (the characteristic solutions of the related Burgers equation) where the problem is still open. On the way to proving the results for TASEP, we obtain the limit processes for the fluctuations in a class of corner growth processes with external sources, of equivalently for the last passage time in a directed percolation model with two-sided boundary conditions. Additionally, we provide analogous results for eigenvalues of perturbed complex Wishart (sample covariance) matrices.',

Two devices are considered, which we represent as different stochastic fragmentation processes. Following the self-similar energy model introduced by Bertoin and Martinez, we compute the average energy required to attain a size x with this two-device procedure. We then asymptotically compare, as x goes to 0 or 1, its energy requirement with that of individual fragmentation processes. In particular, we show that for certain range of parameters of the fragmentation processes and of their energy cost-functions, the consecutive use of two devices can be asymptotically more efficient than using each of them separately, or conversely.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the problem of transferring a file from one source node to multiple receivers in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum download time (WSDT) for the one-to-many file transfer. Previous work has shown that, given an order at which the receivers finish downloading, the minimum WSD can be solved in polynomial time by convex optimization, and can be achieved by linear network coding, assuming that node uplinks are the only bottleneck in the network. This paper, however, considers heterogeneous peers with both uplink and downlink bandwidth constraints specified. The static scenario is a file-transfer scheme in which the network resource allocation remains static until all receivers finish downloading. This paper first shows that the static scenario may be optimized in polynomial time by convex optimization, and the associated optimal static WSD can be achieved by linear network coding. This paper then presented a lower bound to the minimum WSDT that is easily computed and turns out to be tight across a wide range of parameterizations of the problem. This paper also proposes a static routing-based scheme and a static rateless-coding-based scheme which have almost-optimal empirical performances. The dynamic scenario is a file-transfer scheme which can re-allocate the network resource during the file transfer. This paper proposes a dynamic rateless-coding-based scheme, which provides significantly smaller WSDT than the optimal static scenario does.',

	{'abstract': u'The topological Tverberg theorem states that for any prime power q and continuous map from a (d+1)(q-1)-simplex to R^d, there are q disjoint faces F_i of the simplex whose images intersect. It is possible to put conditions on which pairs of vertices of the simplex that are allowed to be in the same face F_i. A graph with the same vertex set as the simplex, and with two vertices adjacent if they should not be in the same F_i, is called a Tverberg graph if the topological Tverberg theorem still work. These graphs have been studied by Hell, Schoneborn and Ziegler, and it is known that disjoint unions of small paths, cycles, and complete graphs are Tverberg graphs. We find many new examples by establishing a local criterion for a graph to be Tverberg. An easily stated corollary of our main theorem is that if the maximal degree of a graph is D, and D(D+1)&lt;q, then it is a Tverberg graph. We state the affine versions of our results and also describe how they can be used to enumerate Tverberg partitions.',

Anderson later provided an explicit construction, but had to use cell complexes of high dimensions that are homotopy equivalent to lower dimensional spheres. Using diagrams of spaces we give an explicit construction of arrangements in the right dimensions. Swartz asked if it is possible to arrange spheres of codimension two, and we provide a construction for any codimension.

Here, we introduce an explicit family of genus-g bundles which we conjecture are the unique such manifolds of minimal volume. Conditional on a very plausible assumption, we prove that this is indeed the case when g is large. The proof combines a soft geometric limit argument with a detailed Neumann-Zagier asymptotic formula for the volumes of Dehn fillings. Our examples are all Dehn fillings on the sibling of the Whitehead manifold, and we also analyze the dilatations of all closed surface bundles obtained in this way, identifying those with minimal dilatation. This gives new families of pseudo-Anosovs with low dilatation, including a genus 7 example which minimizes dilatation among all those with orientable invariant foliations.',

	{'abstract': u'We prove that the attractor of the 1D quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with a broken phase symmetry has strictly positive space-time entropy for an open set of parameter values. The result is obtained by studying chaotic oscillations in grids of weakly interacting solitons in a class of Ginzburg-Landau type equations. We provide an analytic proof for the existence of two-soliton configurations with chaotic temporal behavior, and construct solutions which are closed to a grid of such chaotic soliton pairs, with every pair in the grid well spatially separated from the neighboring ones for all time. The temporal evolution of the well-separated multi-soliton structures is described by a weakly coupled lattice dynamical system (LDS) for the coordinates and phases of the solitons. We develop a version of normal hyperbolicity theory for the weakly coupled LDSs with continuous time and establish for them the existence of space-time chaotic patterns similar to the Sinai-Bunimovich chaos in discrete-time LDSs. While the LDS part of the theory may be of independent interest, the main difficulty addressed in the paper concerns with lifting the space-time chaotic solutions of the LDS back to the initial PDE. The equations we consider here are space-time autonomous, i.e. we impose no spatial or temporal modulation which could prevent the individual solitons in the grid from drifting towards each other and destroying the well-separated grid structure in a finite time. We however manage to show that the set of space-time chaotic solutions for which the random soliton drift is arrested is large enough, so the corresponding space-time entropy is strictly positive.',

	{'abstract': u'Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) is known to be a key technology for next generation mobile communications systems, as it allows to overcome the burden of inter-cell interference. Especially in the uplink, it is likely that interference exploitation schemes will be used in the near future, as they can be used with legacy terminals and require no or little changes in standardization. Major drawbacks, however, are the extent of additional backhaul infrastructure needed, and the sensitivity to imperfect channel knowledge. This paper jointly addresses both issues in a new framework incorporating a multitude of proposed theoretical uplink CoMP concepts, which are then put into perspective with practical CoMP algorithms. This comprehensive analysis provides new insight into the potential usage of uplink CoMP in next generation wireless communications systems.',

We prove a complexity result for recognizing a 3-Pfaffian 3-graph and describe two large classes of 3-Pfaffian 3-graphs -- one of these is given by a forbidden subgraph characterization analogous to Little\'s for bipartite Pfaffian graphs, and the other consists of a class of partial Steiner triple systems for which the property of being 3-Pfaffian can be reduced to the property of an associated graph being Pfaffian. We exhibit an infinite set of partial Steiner triple systems that are not 3-Pfaffian, none of which can be reduced to any other by deletion or contraction of triples. We also find some necessary or sufficient conditions for the existence of a spanning tree of a 3-graph (much more succinct than can be obtained by the currently fastest polynomial-time algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann for finding a spanning tree) and a superexponential lower bound on the number of spanning trees of a Steiner triple system.',

Using more sophisticated methods, we then show that the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture holds for E over K_d, and we relate the index of V_d in E(K_d) to the order of the Tate-Shafarevich group sha(E/K_d). When k has characteristic 0, we show that E has rank 0 over K_d for all d.',

	{'abstract': u'We focus on the downlink of a cellular system, which corresponds to the bulk of the data transfer in such wireless systems. We address the problem of opportunistic multiuser scheduling under imperfect channel state information, by exploiting the memory inherent in the channel. In our setting, the channel between the base station and each user is modeled by a two-state Markov chain and the scheduled user sends back an ARQ feedback signal that arrives at the scheduler with a random delay that is i.i.d across users and time. The scheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedback and uses this information to make scheduling decisions. We formulate a throughput maximization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). For the case of two users in the system, we show that a greedy policy is sum throughput optimal for any distribution on the ARQ feedback delay. For the case of more than two users, we prove that the greedy policy is suboptimal and demonstrate, via numerical studies, that it has near optimal performance. We show that the greedy policy can be implemented by a simple algorithm that does not require the statistics of the underlying Markov channel or the ARQ feedback delay, thus making it robust against errors in system parameter estimation. Establishing an equivalence between the two-user system and a genie-aided system, we obtain a simple closed form expression for the sum capacity of the Markov-modeled downlink. We further derive inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the Markov-modeled downlink and tighten these bounds for special cases of the system parameters.',

	{'abstract': u'Let g be a complex reductive Lie algebra with Cartan algebra h. Hotta and Kashiwara defined a holonomic D-module M, on g x h, called Harish-Chandra module. We give an explicit description of gr(M), the associated graded module with respect to a canonical Hodge filtration on M. The description involves the isospectral commuting variety, a subvariety X of g x g x h x h which is a finite extension of the variety of pairs of commuting elements of g. Our main result establishes an isomorphism of gr(M) with the structure sheaf of the normalization of X. It follows, thanks to the theory of polarized Hodge modules, that the normalization of the isospectral commuting variety is Cohen-Macaulay and Gorenstein, confirming a conjecture of M. Haiman. In the special case where g=gl_n, there is an open subset of the isospectral commuting variety that is closely related to the Hilbert scheme of n points in the plane. The sheaf gr(M) gives rise to a locally free sheaf on the Hilbert scheme. We show that the corresponding vector bundle is isomorphic to the Procesi bundle that plays an important role in the work of M. Haiman.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper is devoted to the study of the Higgs bundle associated with the universal abelian variety over the good reduction of a Shimura curve of PEL type. Due to the endomorphism structure, the Higgs bundle decomposes into the direct sum of Higgs subbundles of rank two. They are basically divided into two type: uniformizing type and unitary type. As the first application we obtain the mass formula counting the number of geometric points of the degeneracy locus in the Newton polygon stratification. We show that each Higgs subbundle is Higgs semistable. Furthermore, for each Higgs subbundle of unitary type, either it is strongly semistable, or its Frobenius pull-back of a suitable power achieves the upper bound of the instability. We describe the Simpson-Ogus-Vologodsky correspondence for the Higgs subbundles in terms of the classical Cartier descent.',

In order of increasing strength, these criteria are: (i) Dobrushin criterion, obtained by a simple inductive argument; (ii) Gruber-Kunz criterion obtained through the use of Kirkwood-Salzburg equations, and (iii) a criterion obtained by two of us via a direct combinatorial handling of the terms of the expansion. We show that for subset polymers our sharper criterion can be proven both by a suitable adaptation of Dobrushin inductive argument and by an alternative --in fact, more elementary-- handling of the Kirkwood-Salzburg equations. In addition we show that for general abstract polymers this alternative treatment leads to the same convergence region as the inductive Dobrushin argument and, furthermore, to a systematic way to improve bounds on correlations.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of construction of Barabanov norms for analysis of properties of the joint (generalized) spectral radius of matrix sets has been discussed in a number of publications. In previous papers of the author the method of Barabanov norms was the key instrument in disproving the Lagarias-Wang Finiteness Conjecture. The related constructions were essentially based on the study of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of some specific Barabanov norms. In this context the situation when one fails to find among current publications any detailed analysis of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of Barabanov norms looks a bit paradoxical. Partially this is explained by the fact that Barabanov norms are defined nonconstructively, by an implicit procedure. So, even in simplest cases it is very difficult to visualize the shape of their unit balls. The present work may be treated as the first step to make up this deficiency. In the paper an iteration procedure is considered that allows to build numerically Barabanov norms for the irreducible matrix sets and simultaneously to compute the joint spectral radius of these sets.',

The fact that the rational solutions of the CYBE for the simple complex Lie algebras can be interpreted in term of certain linear operators motivates us to give the notion of -operators such that these linear operators are the -operators associated to the adjoint representations. Such a study can be generalized to the Lie algebras with nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear forms. Furthermore we give a construction of a rational solution of the CYBE from an -operator associated to the coadjoint representation and an arbitrary representation with a trivial product in the representation space respectively.',

First, we review some recent results that make use of the maximum likelihood of the limiting equation. In particular, it has been shown that in the averaging case, the MLE will be asymptotically consistent in the limit while in the homogenization case, the MLE will be asymptotically consistent only if we subsample the data. Then, we focus on the problem of estimating the diffusion coefficient. We suggest a novel approach that makes use of the total -variation, as defined in the theory of rough paths and avoids the subsampling step. The method is applied to a multiscale OU process.',

	{'abstract': u'The max-product algorithm, a local message-passing scheme that attempts to compute the most probable assignment (MAP) of a given probability distribution, has been successfully employed as a method of approximate inference for applications arising in coding theory, computer vision, and machine learning. However, the max-product algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the MAP assignment, and if it does, is not guaranteed to recover the MAP assignment. Alternative convergent message-passing schemes have been proposed to overcome these difficulties. This work provides a systematic study of such message-passing algorithms that extends the known results by exhibiting new sufficient conditions for convergence to local and/or global optima, providing a combinatorial characterization of these optima based on graph covers, and describing a new convergent and correct message-passing algorithm whose derivation unifies many of the known convergent message-passing algorithms. While convergent and correct message-passing algorithms represent a step forward in the analysis of max-product style message-passing algorithms, the conditions needed to guarantee convergence to a global optimum can be too restrictive in both theory and practice. This limitation of convergent and correct message-passing schemes is characterized by graph covers and illustrated by example.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of subspace estimation in situations where the number of available snapshots and the observation dimension are comparable in magnitude. In this context, traditional subspace methods tend to fail because the eigenvectors of the sample correlation matrix are heavily biased with respect to the true ones. It has recently been suggested that this situation (where the sample size is small compared to the observation dimension) can be very accurately modeled by considering the asymptotic regime where the observation dimension and the number of snapshots converge to at the same rate. Using large random matrix theory results, it can be shown that traditional subspace estimates are not consistent in this asymptotic regime. Furthermore, new consistent subspace estimate can be proposed, which outperform the standard subspace methods for realistic values of and . The work carried out so far in this area has always been based on the assumption that the observations are random, independent and identically distributed in the time domain. The goal of this paper is to propose new consistent subspace estimators for the case where the source signals are modelled as unknown deterministic signals. In practice, this allows to use the proposed approach regardless of the statistical properties of the source signals. In order to construct the proposed estimators, new technical results concerning the almost sure location of the eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices of Information plus Noise complex Gaussian models are established. These results are believed to be of independent interest.',

	{'abstract': u'Vector is a physical quantity and it does not depend on any co-ordinate system. It need to be expanded in some basis for practical calculation and its components do depend on the chosen basis. The expansion in orthonormal basis is mathematically simple. But in many physical situations we have to choose an non-orthogonal basis (or oblique co-ordinate system). But the expansion of a vector in non-orthogonal basis is not convenient to work with. With the notion of contravariant and covariant components of a vector, we make non-orthogonal basis to behave like orthonormal basis. The same notion appears in quantum mechanics as Ket and Bra vectors and we compare the two equivalent situation via the completeness relation. This notion appears in the differential geometry of a metric manifold for tangent vectors at a point, where it takes into account the non-orthogonality of basis as well as non-Euclidean geometry.',

We improve and generalize this result here. We begin with an alternative proof based on geometric intuition. We then prove an interesting symmetry of these roots about the real number -2. This symmetry can be seen via a nice algebraic realization of barycentric subdivision as a simple map on formal power series in two variables. Finally, we use this algebraic machinery with some geometric motivation to generalize the combinatorial statements to arbitrary subdivision methods: any subdivision method will exhibit similar limit behavior and symmetry. Our techniques allow us to compute explicit formulas for the values of the limit roots in the case of barycentric subdivision.',

	{'abstract': u'The theory of (Muckenhoupt) weights arises in many areas of analysis, for example in connection with bounds for singular integrals and maximal functions on weighted spaces. We prove that a certain averaging process gives a method for constructing A_p weights from a measurably varying family of dyadic A_p weights. This averaging process is suggested by the relationship between the A_p weight class and the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. The same averaging process also constructs weights satisfying reverse Holder (RH_p) conditions from families of dyadic RH_p weights, and extends to the polydisc as well.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider full-duplex and half-duplex Gaussian relay channels where the noises at the relay and destination are arbitrarily correlated. We first derive the capacity upper bound and the achievable rates with three existing schemes: Decode-and-Forward (DF), Compress-and-Forward (CF), and Amplify-and-Forward (AF). We present two capacity results under specific noise correlation coefficients, one being achieved by DF and the other being achieved by direct link transmission (or a special case of CF). The channel for the former capacity result is equivalent to the traditional Gaussian degraded relay channel and the latter corresponds to the Gaussian reversely-degraded relay channel. For CF and AF schemes, we show that their achievable rates are strictly decreasing functions over the negative correlation coefficient. Through numerical comparisons under different channel settings, we observe that although DF completely disregards the noise correlation while the other two can potentially exploit such extra information, none of the three relay schemes always outperforms the others over different correlation coefficients. Moreover, the exploitation of noise correlation by CF and AF accrues more benefit when the source-relay link is weak. This paper also considers the optimal power allocation problem under the correlated-noise channel setting. With individual power constraints at the relay and the source, it is shown that the relay should use all its available power to maximize the achievable rates under any correlation coefficient. With a total power constraint across the source and the relay, the achievable rates are proved to be concave functions over the power allocation factor for AF and CF under full-duplex mode, where the closed-form power allocation strategy is derived.',

	{'abstract': u'A noisy network coding scheme for sending multiple sources over a general noisy network is presented. For multi-source multicast networks, the scheme naturally extends both network coding over noiseless networks by Ahlswede, Cai, Li, and Yeung, and compress-forward coding for the relay channel by Cover and El Gamal to general discrete memoryless and Gaussian networks. The scheme also recovers as special cases the results on coding for wireless relay networks and deterministic networks by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse, and coding for wireless erasure networks by Dana, Gowaikar, Palanki, Hassibi, and Effros. The scheme involves message repetition coding, relay signal compression, and simultaneous decoding. Unlike previous compress--forward schemes, where independent messages are sent over multiple blocks, the same message is sent multiple times using independent codebooks as in the network coding scheme for cyclic networks. Furthermore, the relays do not use Wyner--Ziv binning as in previous compress-forward schemes, and each decoder performs simultaneous joint typicality decoding on the received signals from all the blocks without explicitly decoding the compression indices. A consequence of this new scheme is that achievability is proved simply and more generally without resorting to time expansion to extend results for acyclic networks to networks with cycles. The noisy network coding scheme is then extended to general multi-source networks by combining it with decoding techniques for interference channels. For the Gaussian multicast network, noisy network coding improves the previously established gap to the cutset bound. We also demonstrate through two popular AWGN network examples that noisy network coding can outperform conventional compress-forward, amplify-forward, and hash-forward schemes.',

	{'abstract': u'We study asymptotic dynamics of a coupled system consisting of linearized 3D Navier--Stokes equations in a bounded domain and the classical (nonlinear) elastic plate equation for in-plane motions on a flexible flat part of the boundary. The main peculiarity of the model is the assumption that the transversal displacements of the plate are negligible relative to in-plane displacements. This kind of models arises in the study of blood flows in large arteries. Our main result states the existence of a compact global attractor of finite dimension. We also show that the corresponding linearized system generates exponentially stable -semigroup. We do not assume any kind of mechanical damping in the plate component. Thus our results means that dissipation of the energy in the fluid due to viscosity is sufficient to stabilize the system.',

Specifically, we prove a lower bound of (upper bound of dB) on the threshold of -regular LDPC codes whose factor graphs have logarithmic girth. Our proof is an extension of a recent paper of Arora, Daskalakis, and Steurer [STOC 2009] who presented a novel probabilistic analysis of LP decoding over a binary symmetric channel.

Various methods have been devised to continuously spread out the analysis increments over a fixed time interval centered about analysis time. Among these techniques are nudging and incremental analysis updates (IAU). Here we propose another alternative, which may be viewed as a hybrid of nudging and IAU and which arises naturally from a recently proposed continuous formulation of the ensemble Kalman analysis step. A new slow-fast extension of the popular Lorenz-96 model is introduced to demonstrate the properties of the proposed mollified ensemble Kalman filter.',

	{'abstract': u'We address the question of existence of nonconstant stable stationary solution to the heat equation on a class of convex domains subject to nonlinear boundary flux involving a positive parameter. Such solutions which were known to exist in dumbbell-type domains and not to exist in -dimensional balls are shown to exist in some convex domains obtained by smoothing out, in a convenient way, the edges and corners of a cube. Therefore convexity of the domain is not a necessary condition for nonexistence of this type of solutions. If the parameter is small enough we prove that the only equilibria are the constant ones by using the Implicit Function Theorem in a special setting. Symmetry inheritance by local minimizers from symmetry properties of the domain is also addressed.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the role of cooperation in wireless networks subject to a spatial degrees of freedom limitation. To address the worst case scenario, we consider a free-space line-of-sight type environment with no scattering and no fading. We identify three qualitatively different operating regimes that are determined by how the area of the network A, normalized with respect to the wavelength lambda, compares to the number of users n. In networks with sqrt/lambda &lt; sqrt, the limitation in spatial degrees of freedom does not allow to achieve a capacity scaling better than sqrt and this performance can be readily achieved by multi-hopping. This result has been recently shown by Franceschetti et al. However, for networks with sqrt/lambda &gt; sqrt, the number of available degrees of freedom is min(n, sqrt/lambda), larger that what can be achieved by multi-hopping. We show that the optimal capacity scaling in this regime is achieved by hierarchical cooperation. In particular, in networks with sqrt/lambda&gt; n, hierarchical cooperation can achieve linear scaling.',

	{'abstract': u"The properties of a prescription for the inner products of the resonance (Gamow states), scattering (Dirac kets), and bound states for 1-dimensional quantum barriers are worked out. The divergent asypmtotic behaviour of the Gamow states is regularized using a Gaussian convergence factor first introduced by Zel'dovich. With this prescription, most of these states (with discrete complex energies) are found to be orthogonal to each other, to the bound states, and to the Dirac kets, except when they are neighbors, in which case the inner product is divergent. Therefore, as it happens for the continuum scattering states, the norm of the resonant ones remains non-calculable. Thus, they exhibit properties half way between the (continuum real) Dirac-delta orthogonality and the (discrete real) Kronecker-delta orthogonality of the bound states.",

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the multipath fading relay channel in the limit of a large bandwidth, and in the non-coherent setting, where the channel state is unknown to all terminals, including the relay and the destination. We propose a hypergraph model of the wideband multipath fading relay channel, and show that its min-cut is achieved by a non-coherent peaky frequency binning scheme. The so-obtained lower bound on the capacity of the wideband multipath fading relay channel turns out to coincide with the block-Markov lower bound on the capacity of the wideband frequency-division Gaussian (FD-AWGN) relay channel. In certain cases, this achievable rate also meets the cut-set upper-bound, and thus reaches the capacity of the non-coherent wideband multipath fading relay channel.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we derive lower bounds in minimax sense for estimation of the instantaneous volatility if the diffusion type part cannot be observed directly but under some additional Gaussian noise. Three different models are considered. Our technique is based on a general inequality for Kullback-Leibler divergence of multivariate normal random variables and spectral analysis of the processes. The derived lower bounds are indeed optimal. Upper bounds can be found in Munk and Schmidt-Hieber [18]. Our major finding is that the Gaussian microstructure noise introduces an additional degree of ill-posedness for each model, respectively.',

	{'abstract': u'Let d = (d1, d2, ..., dn) be a vector of non-negative integers with even sum. We prove some basic facts about the structure of a random graph with degree sequence d, including the probability of a given subgraph or induced subgraph. Although there are many results of this kind, they are restricted to the sparse case with only a few exceptions. Our focus is instead on the case where the average degree is approximately a constant fraction of n. Our approach is the multidimensional saddle-point method. This extends the enumerative work of McKay and Wormald (1990) and is analogous to the theory developed for bipartite graphs by Greenhill and McKay (arXiv:math/0701600, 2009).',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a binary erasure version of the n-channel multiple descriptions problem with symmetric descriptions, i.e., the rates of the n descriptions are the same and the distortion constraint depends only on the number of messages received. We consider the case where there is no excess rate for every k out of n descriptions. Our goal is to characterize the achievable distortions D_1, D_2,...,D_n. We measure the fidelity of reconstruction using two distortion criteria: an average-case distortion criterion, under which distortion is measured by taking the average of the per-letter distortion over all source sequences, and a worst-case distortion criterion, under which distortion is measured by taking the maximum of the per-letter distortion over all source sequences. We present achievability schemes, based on random binning for average-case distortion and systematic MDS (maximum distance separable) codes for worst-case distortion, and prove optimality results for the corresponding achievable distortion regions. We then use the binary erasure multiple descriptions setup to propose a layered coding framework for multiple descriptions, which we then apply to vector Gaussian multiple descriptions and prove its optimality for symmetric scalar Gaussian multiple descriptions with two levels of receivers and no excess rate for the central receiver. We also prove a new outer bound for the general multi-terminal source coding problem and use it to prove an optimality result for the robust binary erasure CEO problem. For the latter, we provide a tight lower bound on the distortion for ell messages for any coding scheme that achieves the minimum achievable distortion for k messages where k is less than or equal to ell.',

However, one has to mitigate the resulting noise and decoherence effects to avoid computational errors in order to successfully build quantum computers. In this paper, we construct asymmetric quantum codes to protect quantum information over asymmetric quantum channels, . Two generic methods are presented to derive asymmetric quantum cyclic codes using the generator polynomials and defining sets of classical cyclic codes. Consequently, the methods allow us to construct several families of quantum BCH, RS, and RM codes over asymmetric quantum channels.

	{'abstract': u"Femtocells are assuming an increasingly important role in the coverage and capacity of cellular networks. In contrast to existing cellular systems, femtocells are end-user deployed and controlled, randomly located, and rely on third party backhaul (e.g. DSL or cable modem). Femtocells can be configured to be either open access or closed access. Open access allows an arbitrary nearby cellular user to use the femtocell, whereas closed access restricts the use of the femtocell to users explicitly approved by the owner. Seemingly, the network operator would prefer an open access deployment since this provides an inexpensive way to expand their network capabilities, whereas the femtocell owner would prefer closed access, in order to keep the femtocell's capacity and backhaul to himself. We show mathematically and through simulations that the reality is more complicated for both parties, and that the best approach depends heavily on whether the multiple access scheme is orthogonal (TDMA or OFDMA, per subband) or non-orthogonal (CDMA). In a TDMA/OFDMA network, closed-access is typically preferable at high user densities, whereas in CDMA, open access can provide gains of more than 200% for the home user by reducing the near-far problem experienced by the femtocell. The results of this paper suggest that the interests of the femtocell owner and the network operator are more compatible than typically believed, and that CDMA femtocells should be configured for open access whereas OFDMA or TDMA femtocells should adapt to the cellular user density.",

	{'abstract': u'The vertex-random graphs called proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) have been introduced recently and have applications in pattern recognition and spatial pattern analysis. A PCD is a random directed graph (i.e., digraph) which is constructed from data using the relative positions of the points from various classes. Different PCDs result from different definitions of the proximity region associated with each data point. We consider the underlying and reflexivity graphs based on a family of PCDs which is determined by a family of parameterized proximity maps called proportional-edge (PE) proximity map. The graph invariant we investigate is the relative edge density of the underlying and reflexivity graphs. We demonstrate that, properly scaled, relative edge density of these graphs is a -statistic, and hence obtain the asymptotic normality of the relative edge density for data from any distribution that satisfies mild regulatory conditions. By detailed probabilistic and geometric calculations, we compute the explicit form of the asymptotic normal distribution for uniform data on a bounded region in the usual Euclidean plane. We also compare the relative edge densities of the two types of the graphs and the relative arc density of the PE-PCDs. The approach presented here is also valid for data in higher dimensions.',

	{'abstract': u'Kinetic relations are required in order to characterize nonclassical undercompressive shock waves and formulate a well-posed initial value problem for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Such nonclassical waves arise in weak solutions of a large variety of physical models: phase transitions, thin liquid films, magnetohydrodynamics, Camassa-Holm model, martensite-austenite materials, semi-conductors, combustion theory, etc. This review presents the research done in the last fifteen years which led the development of the theory of kinetic relations for undercompressive shocks and has now covered many physical, mathematical, and numerical issues. The main difficulty overcome here in our analysis of nonclassical entropy solutions comes from their lack of monotonicity with respect to initial data. Undercompressive shocks of hyperbolic conservation laws turn out to exhibit features that are very similar to shocks of nonconservative hyperbolic systems, who were investigated earlier by the author.',

	{'abstract': u"Mathematical modeling of many physical processes such as diffusion, viscosity of fluids and combustion involves differential equations with small coefficients of higher derivatives. These may be small diffusion coefficients for modeling the spreading of impurities, small coefficients of viscosity in fluid flow simulation etc. The difficulty with solving such problem is that if you set the small parameter at higher derivatives to zero, the solution of the degenerate problem doesn't correctly approximate the original problem, even if the small parameter approaches zero; the solution of the original problem exhibits the emergency of a boundary layer. As a result, the application of classical difference schemes for solving such equations produces great inaccuracies. Therefore, numerical solution of differential equations with small coefficients at higher derivatives demands special difference schemes exhibiting uniform convergence with respect to the small parameters involved. In this article author investigates two nonlinear boundary value problems on a finite interval, resulting in exponential and power-law boundary layers.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates existence of the nonstandard Pade approximants introduced by Cherkaev and Zhang in J. Comp. Phys. 2009 for approximating the spectral function of composites from effective properties at different frequencies. The spectral functions contain microstructure information. Since this reconstruction problem is ill-posed [9], the well-performed Pade approach is noteworthy and requires further investigations. In this paper, we validate the assumption that the effective dielectric component of interest can be approximated by Pade approximants whose denominator has nonzero power one term. We refer to this as the nonstandard Pade approximant, in contrast to the standard approximants with nonzero constant terms. For composites whose spectral function assumes infinitely many different values, the proof is carried by using classic results for Stieltjes functions. For those with spectral functions having only finitely many different values, we prove the results by utilizing a special product decomposition of the coefficient matrix of the Pade system. The results in this paper can be considered as an extension of the Pade theory for Stieltjes functions whose spectral function take infinitely many different values to those taking only finitely many values. In the literature, the latter is usually excluded from the definition of Stieltjes functions because they correspond to rational functions, hence convergence of their Pade approximants is trivial. However, from an inverse problem point of view, our main concern is the existence of the nonstandard Pade approximants, rather than their convergence. The results in this paper provide a mathematical foundation for applying the Pade approach for reconstructing the spectral functions of composites whose microstructure is not a priori known.',

We work without bounded distorsion property assumption. We express the whole Hausdorff spectrum in terms of a conditional variational principle, as well as a new large deviations principle. Our approach provides a new description of the structure of the spectrum in terms of concavity. Another new point is that we consider sets of points at which the asymptotic behavior of is localized, i.e. depends on the point rather than being equal to a constant. Specifically, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of sets of the form , where is a given continuous function. This is naturally related to Birkhoff's ergodic theorem and has interesting geometric applications to fixed points in the asymptotic average for dynamical systems in , as well as the fine local behavior of the harmonic measure on conformal planar Cantor sets.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents an inverse optimality method to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for a class of nonlinear problems for which the cost is quadratic and the dynamics are affine in the input. The method is inverse optimal because the running cost that renders the control input optimal is also explicitly determined. One special feature of this work, as compared to other methods in the literature, is the fact that the solution is obtained directly for the control input. The value function can also be obtained after one solves for the control input. Furthermore, a Lyapunov function that proves at least local stability of the controller is also obtained. In this regard the main contribution of this paper can be interpreted in two different ways: offering an analytical expression for Lyapunov functions for a class of nonlinear systems and obtaining an optimal controller for the same class of systems using a specific optimization functional. We also believe that an additional contribution of this paper is to identify explicit classes of systems and optimization functionals for which optimal control problems can be solved analytically. In particular, for second order systems three cases are identified: i) control input only as a function of the second state variable, ii) control input affine in the second state variable when the dynamics are affine in that variable and iii) control input affine in the first state variable when the dyamics are affine in that variable. The relevance of the proposed methodology is illustrated in several examples, including the Van der Pol oscillator, mass-spring systems and vehicle path following.',

	{'abstract': u'In a context of multiple hypothesis testing, we provide several new exact calculations related to the false discovery proportion (FDP) of step-up and step-down procedures. For step-up procedures, we show that the number of erroneous rejections conditionally on the rejection number is simply a binomial variable, which leads to explicit computations of the c.d.f., the moment and the mean of the FDP, the latter corresponding to the false discovery rate (FDR). For step-down procedures, we derive what is to our knowledge the first explicit formula for the FDR valid for any alternative c.d.f. of the -values. We also derive explicit computations of the power for both step-up and step-down procedures. These formulas are "explicit" in the sense that they only involve the parameters of the model and the c.d.f. of the order statistics of i.i.d. uniform variables. The -values are assumed either independent or coming from an equicorrelated multivariate normal model and an additional mixture model for the true/false hypotheses is used. This new approach is used to investigate new results which are of interest in their own right, related to least/most favorable configurations for the FDR and the variance of the FDP.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper develops a distributed algorithm for rate allocation in wireless networks that achieves the same throughput region as optimal centralized algorithms. This cross-layer algorithm jointly performs medium access control (MAC) and physical-layer rate adaptation. The paper establishes that this algorithm is throughput-optimal for general rate regions. In contrast to on-off scheduling, rate allocation enables optimal utilization of physical-layer schemes by scheduling multiple rate levels. The algorithm is based on local queue-length information, and thus the algorithm is of significant practical value. The algorithm requires that each link can determine the global feasibility of increasing its current data-rate. In many classes of networks, any one link's data-rate primarily impacts its neighbors and this impact decays with distance. Hence, local exchanges can provide the information needed to determine feasibility. Along these lines, the paper discusses the potential use of existing physical-layer control messages to determine feasibility. This can be considered as a technique analogous to carrier sensing in CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) networks. An important application of this algorithm is in multiple-band multiple-radio throughput-optimal distributed scheduling for white-space networks.",

With this goal in mind, here for the first time we obtain fully explicit bounds for the number of rational points near planar curves. Further, introducing a perturbational approach we bring the smoothness condition imposed on the curves down to (lowest possible). This way we broaden the notion of non-degeneracy in a natural direction and introduce a new topologically complete class of planar curves to the theory of Diophantine approximation. In summary, our findings improve and complete the main theorems of [Ann. of Math.(2) 166 (2007), p.367-426] and extend the celebrated theorem of Kleinbock and Margulis appeared in [Ann. of Math.(2), 148 (1998), p.339-360] in dimension 2 beyond the notion of non-degeneracy.',

	{'abstract': u'We study closed choice principles for different spaces. Given information about what does not constitute a solution, closed choice determines a solution. We show that with closed choice one can characterize several models of hypercomputation in a uniform framework using Weihrauch reducibility. The classes of functions which are reducible to closed choice of the singleton space, of the natural numbers, of Cantor space and of Baire space correspond to the class of computable functions, of functions computable with finitely many mind changes, of weakly computable functions and of effectively Borel measurable functions, respectively. We also prove that all these classes correspond to classes of non-deterministically computable functions with the respective spaces as advice spaces. Moreover, we prove that closed choice on Euclidean space can be considered as "locally compact choice" and it is obtained as product of closed choice on the natural numbers and on Cantor space. We also prove a Quotient Theorem for compact choice which shows that single-valued functions can be "divided" by compact choice in a certain sense. Another result is the Independent Choice Theorem, which provides a uniform proof that many choice principles are closed under composition. Finally, we also study the related class of low computable functions, which contains the class of weakly computable functions as well as the class of functions computable with finitely many mind changes. As one main result we prove a uniform version of the Low Basis Theorem that states that closed choice on Cantor space (and the Euclidean space) is low computable. We close with some related observations on the Turing jump operation and its initial topology.',

	{'abstract': u"Motivated by issues arising in computer science, we investigate the loop-free paths from the identity transformation and corresponding straight words in the Cayley graph of a finite transformation semigroup with a fixed generator set. Of special interest are words that permute a given subset of the state set. Certain such words, called minimal permutators, are shown to comprise a code, and the straight ones comprise a finite code. Thus, words that permute a given subset are uniquely factorizable as products of the subset's minimal permutators, and these can be further reduced to straight minimal permutators. This leads to insight into structure of local pools of reversibility in transformation semigroups in terms of the set of words permuting a given subset. These findings can be exploited in practical calculations for hierarchical decompositions of finite automata. As an example we consider groups arising in biological systems.",

	{'abstract': u"It is well known that the triviality problem for finitely presented groups is unsolvable; we ask the question of whether there exists a general procedure to produce a non-trivial element from a finite presentation of a non-trivial group. If not, then this would resolve an open problem by J. Wiegold: `Is every finitely generated perfect group the normal closure of one element?' We prove a weakened version of our question: there is no general procedure to pick a non-trivial generator from a finite presentation of a non-trivial group. We also show there is neither a general procedure to decompose a finite presentation of a non-trivial free product into two non-trivial finitely presented factors, nor one to construct an embedding from one finitely presented group into another in which it embeds. We apply our results to show that a construction by Stallings on splitting groups with more than one end can never be made algorithmic, nor can the process of splitting connect sums of non-simply connected closed 4-manifolds.",

	{'abstract': u'We study branching random walks on Cayley graphs. A first result is that the trace of a transient branching random walk on a Cayley graph is a.s. transient for the simple random walk. In addition, it has a.s. critical percolation probability less than one and exponential volume growth. The proofs rely on the fact that the trace induces an invariant percolation on the family tree of the branching random walk. Furthermore, we prove that the trace is a.s. strongly recurrent for any (non-trivial) branching random walk. This follows from the observation that the trace, after appropriate biasing of the root, defines a unimodular measure. All results are stated in the more general context of branching random walks on unimodular random graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce the notion of Artin motives and cohomological motives over a scheme X. Given a cohomological motive M over X, we construct its punctual weight zero part as the universal Artin motive mapping to M. We use this to define a motive E_X over X which is an invariant of the singularities of X. The first half of the paper is devoted to the study of the functors and the computation of the motives E_X. In the second half of the paper, we develop the application to locally symmetric varieties. Specifically, let Y be a locally symmetric variety and denote by p:W--&gt;Z the projection of its reductive Borel-Serre compactification W onto its Baily-Borel Satake compactification Z. We show that is naturally isomorphic to the Betti realization of the motive E_Z, where Z is viewed as a scheme. In particular, the direct image of E_Z along the projection of Z to Spec(C) gives a motive whose Betti realization is naturally isomorphic to the cohomology of W.',

Generalized symbol functions can be derived leading to power series expansions which are convergent on arbitrary domains in special cases.

	{'abstract': u"The article concerns the dual of Lusztig's canonical basis of a subalgebra of the positive part U_q(n) of the universal enveloping algebra of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra of type A_1^. The examined subalgebra is associated with a terminal module M over the path algebra of the Kronecker quiver via an Weyl group element w of length four. Geiss-Leclerc-Schroeer attached to M a category C_M of nilpotent modules over the preprojective algebra of the Kronecker quiver together with an acyclic cluster algebra A(C_M). The dual semicanonical basis contains all cluster monomials. By construction, the cluster algebra A(C_M) is a subalgebra of the graded dual of the (non-quantized) universal enveloping algebra U(n). We transfer to the quantized setup. Following Lusztig we attach to w a subalgebra U_q^+(w) of U_q(n). The subalgebra is generated by four elements that satisfy straightening relations; it degenerates to a commutative algebra in the classical limit q=1. The algebra U_q^+(w) possesses four bases, a PBW basis, a canonical basis, and their duals. We prove recursions for dual canonical basis elements. The recursions imply that every cluster variable in A(C_M) is the specialization of the dual of an appropriate canonical basis element. Therefore, U_q^+(w) is a quantum cluster algebra in the sense of Berenstein-Zelevinsky. Furthermore, we give explicit formulae for the quantized cluster variables and for expansions of products of dual canonical basis elements.",

	{'abstract': u"A combinatorial category Disks was introduced by Andr 'e Joyal to play a role in his definition of weak omega-category. He defined the category Theta to be dual to Disks. In the ensuing literature, a more concrete description of Theta was provided. In this paper we provide another proof of the dual equivalence and introduce various categories equivalent to Disk or Theta, each providing a helpful viewpoint. In this second version the paper's contents have been reorganized with the goal of a more readable presentation. We define augmented categories and their reduced counterparts (which lack a single trivial object of the augmented category). These augmented categories are more suitable for inductive arguments and their reduced counterparts are equivalent to Disk and Theta. The equivalence between Disk and Theta is demonstrated in Sections 4 and 6 using categories inductively defined (in Section 3) from intervals and ordinals. The last two sections take a more categorical perspective, constructing categories of so-called labeled trees and showing that they are equivalent to their inductively defined counterparts, and so to Disk and Theta. The distinction between augmented and reduced categories corrects an error in the first version where the terminal tree was included in the category Disk.",

	{'abstract': u"Extending our earlier study of nonlinear Bogolyubov-Valatin transformations (canonical transformations for fermions) for one fermionic mode, in the present paper we perform a thorough study of general (nonlinear) canonical transformations for two fermionic modes. We find that the Bogolyubov-Valatin group for n=2 fermionic modes which can be implemented by means of unitary SU(2^n = 4) transformations is isomorphic to SO(6;R)/Z_2. The investigation touches on a number of subjects. As a novelty from a mathematical point of view, we study the structure of nonlinear basis transformations in a Clifford algebra [specifically, in the Clifford algebra C(0,4)] entailing (supersymmetric) transformations among multivectors of different grades. A prominent algebraic role in this context is being played by biparavectors (linear combinations of products of Dirac matrices, quadriquaternions, sedenions) and spin bivectors (antisymmetric complex matrices). The studied biparavectors are equivalent to Eddington's E-numbers and can be understood in terms of the tensor product of two commuting copies of the division algebra of quaternions H. From a physical point of view, we present a method to diagonalize any arbitrary two-fermion Hamiltonian. Relying on Jordan-Wigner transformations for two-spin-1/2 and single-spin-3/2 systems, we also study nonlinear spin transformations and the related problem of diagonalizing arbitrary two-spin-1/2 and single-spin-3/2 Hamiltonians. Finally, from a calculational point of view, we pay due attention to explicit parametrizations of SU(4) and SO(6;R) matrices (of respective sizes 4x4 and 6x6) and their mutual relation.",

Our results demonstrate an interesting distinction between the direct integral over the family of operators T(t) with respect to Lebesgue measure and the naturally maximally defined operator associated with pointwise application of T(t) in the vector-valued Hilbert space L^2( mathbb R; dt; H). We also provide explicit criteria for the measurability of the matrix of projections onto the graph Gamma(T(t)) of T(t).',

	{'abstract': u'Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods are a new class of energy preserving one step methods for the solution of polynomial Hamiltonian dynamical systems. They can be thought of as a generalization of collocation methods in that they may be defined by imposing a suitable set of extended collocation conditions. In particular, in the way they are described in this note, they are related to Gauss collocation methods with the difference that they are able to precisely conserve the Hamiltonian function in the case where this is a polynomial of any high degree in the momenta and in the generalized coordinates. A description of these new formulas is followed by a few test problems showing how, in many relevant situations, the precise conservation of the Hamiltonian is crucial to simulate on a computer the correct behavior of the theoretical solutions.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose a blind interference alignment scheme for the vector broadcast channel where the transmitter is equipped with M antennas and there are K receivers, each equipped with a reconfigurable antenna capable of switching among M preset modes. Without any knowledge of the channel coefficient values at the transmitters and with only mild assumptions on the channel coherence structure we show that MK/M+K-1 degrees of freedom are achievable. The key to the blind interference alignment scheme is the ability of the receivers to switch between reconfigurable antenna modes to create short term channel fluctuation patterns that are exploited by the transmitter. The achievable scheme does not require cooperation between transmit antennas and is therefore applicable to the MxK X network as well. Only finite symbol extensions are used, and no channel knowledge at the receivers is required to null the interference.',

The corrected model involves diffusion terms in both the mass and velocity equations as well as terms which are quadratic functions of the first order derivatives of the density and velocity. The derivation method is based on the standard Chapman-Enskog theory, but is significantly more complex than usual due to both the non-isotropy of the fluid and the lack of momentum conservation.',

	{'abstract': u"On a Riemann surface there are relations among the periods of holomorphic differential forms, called Riemann's relations. If one looks carefully in Riemann's proof, one notices that he uses iterated integrals. What I have done in this paper is to generalize these relations to relations among generating series of iterated integrals. Since the main result is formulated in terms of generating series, it gives infinitely many relations - one for each coefficient of the generating series. The lower order terms give the well known classical relations. The new result is reciprocity for the higher degree terms, which give non-trivial relations among iterated integrals on a Riemann surface. As an application we refine the definition of Manin's noncommutative modular symbol in order to include Eisenstein series. Finally, we have to point out that this paper contains some constructions needed for multidimensional reciprocity laws like a refinement of one of the Kato-Parshin reciprocity laws.",

	{'abstract': u'On an algebraic curve there are Tate symbols, which satisfy Weil reciprocity law. The analogues in higher dimensions are the Parshin symbols, which satisfy Kato-Parshin reciprocity laws. We give a refinement of the Parshin symbol for surfaces, using iterated integrals in the sense of Chen. The product of the refined symbol over the cyclic permutations of the functions recovers the Parshin symbol. Also, we construct a logarithmic version of the Parshin symbol. We prove reciprocity laws for both the refined symbol and a logarithm of the Parshin symbol.',

Next, on the hypothesis that the moments of the Hardy Z-function and its derivatives are correctly predicted we establish a new explicit formula of the gaps and use it to establish some lower bounds for k=3,4,...,15. In particular it is proved that lower bound when k=15 is 9.6435 which means that the consecutive nontrivial zeros often differ by at least 9.6435 times the average spacing.

We calculate the constants on both sides in various cases, establishing this connection for a substantial class of elliptic curves. By calculating the arithmetic constants in some new cases, we also extend the class of elliptic curves for which one can determine lower bounds for the growth of p-Selmer rank in dihedral extensions of number fields.',

	{'abstract': u'Cartoon-like images, i.e., C^2 functions which are smooth apart from a C^2 discontinuity curve, have by now become a standard model for measuring sparse (non-linear) approximation properties of directional representation systems. It was already shown that curvelets, contourlets, as well as shearlets do exhibit (almost) optimally sparse approximation within this model. However, all those results are only applicable to band-limited generators, whereas, in particular, spatially compactly supported generators are of uttermost importance for applications. In this paper, we now present the first complete proof of (almost) optimally sparse approximations of cartoon-like images by using a particular class of directional representation systems, which indeed consists of compactly supported elements. This class will be chosen as a subset of shearlet frames -- not necessarily required to be tight -- with shearlet generators having compact support and satisfying some weak moment conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, shearlet systems were introduced as a means to derive efficient encoding methodologies for anisotropic features in 2-dimensional data with a unified treatment of the continuum and digital setting. However, only very few construction strategies for discrete shearlet systems are known so far. In this paper, we take a geometric approach to this problem. Utilizing the close connection with group representations, we first introduce and analyze an upper and lower weighted shearlet density based on the shearlet group. We then apply this geometric measure to provide necessary conditions on the geometry of the sets of parameters for the associated shearlet systems to form a frame for L^2( R^2), either when using all possible generators or a large class exhibiting some decay conditions. While introducing such a feasible class of shearlet generators, we analyze approximation properties of the associated shearlet systems, which themselves lead to interesting insights into homogeneous approximation abilities of shearlet frames. We also present examples, such a oversampled shearlet systems and co-shearlet systems, to illustrate the usefulness of our geometric approach to the construction of shearlet frames.',

	{'abstract': u'Multicast transmission, wherein the same packet must be delivered to multiple receivers, is an important aspect of sensor and tactical networks and has several distinctive traits as opposed to more commonly studied unicast networks. Specially, these include (i) identical packets must be delivered successfully to several nodes, (ii) outage at any receiver requires the packet to be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and (iii) the multicast rate is dominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and retransmission. A first contribution of this paper is the development of a tractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these key traits in a multicast wireless network. We utilize a Poisson cluster process (PCP) consisting of a distinct Poisson point process (PPP) for the transmitters and receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (MTC) as the maximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximum intensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outage constraints. A multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet is multicasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into smaller regions of multicast. The second contribution of the paper is the analysis of several key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following main result. Assuming transmission attempts are allowed for each tessellated region in a multicast cluster, we show that the MTC is where , and are functions of and depending on the network size and intensity, and is the average number of the intended receivers in a cluster. We derive for a number of regimes of interest, and also show that an appropriate number of retransmissions can significantly enhance the MTC.',

	{'abstract': u"The main goal of this paper is to deduce (from a recent resolution of singularities result of Gabber) the following fact: (effective) Chow motives with -coefficients over a perfect field of characteristic generate the category (of effective geometric Voevodsky's motives with -coefficients). It follows that could be endowed with a Chow weight structure whose heart is (weight structures were introduced in a preceding paper, where the existence of for was also proved). As shown in previous papers, this statement immediately yields the existence of a conservative weight complex functor (which induces an isomorphism on -groups), as well as the existence of canonical and functorial (Chow)-weight spectral sequences and weight filtrations for any cohomology theory on . We also define a certain Chow t-structure for and relate it with unramified cohomology. To this end we study birational motives and birational homotopy invariant sheaves with transfers.",

	{'abstract': u'The purpose of this paper is to derive rigorously the so called viscous shallow water equations given for instance page 958-959 in [A. Oron, S.H. Davis, S.G. Bankoff, Rev. Mod. Phys, 69 (1997), 931?980]. Such a system of equations is similar to compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a barotropic fluid with a non-constant viscosity. To do that, we consider a layer of incompressible and Newtonian fluid which is relatively thin, assuming no surface tension at the free surface. The motion of the fluid is described by 3d Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity and free surface. We prove that for a set of suitable initial data (asymptotically close to ?shallow water initial data?), the Cauchy problem for these equations is well-posed, and the solution converges to the solution of viscous shallow water equations. More precisely, we build the solution of the full problem as a perturbation of the strong solution to the viscous shallow water equations. The method of proof is based on a Lagrangian change of variable that fixes the fluid domain and we have to prove the well-posedness in thin domains: we have to pay a special attention to constants in classical Sobolev inequalities and regularity in Stokes problem.',

	{'abstract': u'The fundamental principle underlying compressed sensing is that a signal, which is sparse under some basis representation, can be recovered from a small number of linear measurements. However, prior knowledge of the sparsity basis is essential for the recovery process. This work introduces the concept of blind compressed sensing, which avoids the need to know the sparsity basis in both the sampling and the recovery process. We suggest three possible constraints on the sparsity basis that can be added to the problem in order to make its solution unique. For each constraint we prove conditions for uniqueness, and suggest a simple method to retrieve the solution. Under the uniqueness conditions, and as long as the signals are sparse enough, we demonstrate through simulations that without knowing the sparsity basis our methods can achieve results similar to those of standard compressed sensing, which relay on prior knowledge of the sparsity basis. This offers a general sampling and reconstruction system that fits all sparse signals, regardless of the sparsity basis, under the conditions and constraints presented in this work.',

The algebras are indexed by double partitions or double flag varieties. Equivalently, they are indexed by broken lines . By grouping together neighboring mutations into quantum line mutations we can mutate from the cluster algebra of one broken line to another. Compatible pairs can be written down. The algebras are equal to their upper cluster algebras. The variables of the quantum seeds are given by elements of the dual canonical basis. This is the final version, where some arguments have been expanded and/or improved and several typos corrected.

	{'abstract': u'Burgers vortices are explicit stationary solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations which are often used to describe the vortex tubes observed in numerical simulations of three-dimensional turbulence. In this model, the velocity field is a two-dimensional perturbation of a linear straining flow with axial symmetry. The only free parameter is the Reynolds number , where is the total circulation of the vortex and is the kinematic viscosity. The purpose of this paper is to show that Burgers vortex is asymptotically stable with respect to general three-dimensional perturbations, for all values of the Reynolds number. This definitive result subsumes earlier studies by various authors, which were either restricted to small Reynolds numbers or to two-dimensional perturbations. Our proof relies on the crucial observation that the linearized operator at Burgers vortex has a simple and very specific dependence upon the axial variable. This allows to reduce the full linearized equations to a vectorial two-dimensional problem, which can be treated using an extension of the techniques developped in earlier works. Although Burgers vortices are found to be stable for all Reynolds numbers, the proof indicates that perturbations may undergo an important transient amplification if is large, a phenomenon that was indeed observed in numerical simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'Basing on a modification of the "Dichotomy Algorithm" (Terekhov, 2010), we propose a parallel procedure for solving tridiagonal systems of equations with Toeplitz matrices. Taking the structure of the Toeplitz matrices, we may substantially reduce the number of the "preliminary calculations" of the Dichotomy Algorithm, which makes it possible to effectively solve a series as well as a single system of equations. On the example of solving of elliptic equations by the Separation Variable Method, we show that the computation accuracy is comparable with the sequential version of the Thomas method, and the dependence of the speedup on the number of processors is almost linear. The proposed modification is aimed at parallel realization of a broad class of numerical methods including the inversion of Toeplitz and quasi-Toeplitz tridiagonal matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'We develop a nonanticipative calculus for functionals of a continuous semimartingale, using an extension of the Ito formula to path-dependent functionals which possess certain directional derivatives. The construction is based on a pathwise derivative, introduced by Dupire, for functionals on the space of right-continuous functions with left limits. We show that this functional derivative admits a suitable extension to the space of square-integrable martingales. This extension defines a weak derivative which is shown to be the inverse of the Ito integral and which may be viewed as a nonanticipative "lifting" of the Malliavin derivative. These results lead to a constructive martingale representation formula for Ito processes. By contrast with the Clark-Haussmann-Ocone formula, this representation only involves nonanticipative quantities which may be computed pathwise.',

	{'abstract': u'It is of interest to study a wavelet system with a minimum number of generators. It has been showed by X. Dai, D. R. Larson, and D. M. Speegle in [11] that for any real-valued expansive matrix M, a homogeneous orthonormal M-wavelet basis can be generated by a single wavelet function. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated in [21] that nonhomogeneous wavelet systems, though much less studied in the literature, play a fundamental role in wavelet analysis and naturally link many aspects of wavelet analysis together. In this paper, we are interested in nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in high dimensions with a minimum number of generators. As we shall see in this paper, a nonhomogeneous wavelet system naturally leads to a homogeneous wavelet system with almost all properties preserved. We also show that a nonredundant nonhomogeneous wavelet system is naturally connected to refinable structures and has a fixed number of wavelet generators. Consequently, it is often impossible for a nonhomogeneous orthonormal wavelet basis to have a single wavelet generator. However, for redundant nonhomogeneous wavelet systems, we show that for any real-valued expansive matrix M, we can always construct a nonhomogeneous smooth tight M-wavelet frame in with a single wavelet generator whose Fourier transform is a compactly supported function. Moreover, such nonhomogeneous tight wavelet frames are associated with filter banks and can be modified to achieve directionality in high dimensions. Our analysis of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems employs a notion of frequency-based nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in the distribution space. Such a notion allows us to separate the perfect reconstruction property of a wavelet system from its stability in function spaces.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents some applications of using recently developed algorithms for smooth-continuous data reconstruction based on the digital-discrete method. The classical discrete method for data reconstruction is based on domain decomposition according to guiding (or sample) points. Then uses Splines (for polynomial) or finite elements method (for PDE) to fit the data. Our method is based on the gradually varied function that does not assume the property of the linearly separable among guiding points, i.e. no domain decomposition methods are needed. We also demonstrate the flexibility of the new method and the potential to solve variety of problems. The examples include some real data from water well logs and harmonic functions on closed 2D manifolds. This paper presented the results from six different algorithms. This method can be easily extended to higher multi-dimensions.',

Recall that for any N given solitons, we call multi-soliton a solution of (gKdV) which behaves as the sum of these N solitons asymptotically as time goes to infinity. More recently, for the L^2 supercritical case, Cote, Martel and Merle proved the existence of at least one multi-soliton. In the present paper, as suggested by a previous work concerning the one soliton case, we first construct an N-parameter family of multi-solitons for the supercritical (gKdV) equation, for N arbitrarily given solitons, and then prove that any multi-soliton belongs to this family. In other words, we obtain a complete classification of multi-solitons for (gKdV).',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by linear network coding, communication channels perform linear operation over finite fields, namely linear operator channels (LOCs), are studied in this paper. For such a channel, its output vector is a linear transform of its input vector, and the transformation matrix is randomly and independently generated. The transformation matrix is assumed to remain constant for every T input vectors and to be unknown to both the transmitter and the receiver. There are NO constraints on the distribution of the transformation matrix and the field size. Specifically, the optimality of subspace coding over LOCs is investigated. A lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of subspace coding is obtained and it is shown to be tight for some cases. The maximum achievable rate of constant-dimensional subspace coding is characterized and the loss of rate incurred by using constant-dimensional subspace coding is insignificant. The maximum achievable rate of channel training is close to the lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of subspace coding. Two coding approaches based on channel training are proposed and their performances are evaluated. Our first approach makes use of rank-metric codes and its optimality depends on the existence of maximum rank distance codes. Our second approach applies linear coding and it can achieve the maximum achievable rate of channel training. Our code designs require only the knowledge of the expectation of the rank of the transformation matrix. The second scheme can also be realized ratelessly without a priori knowledge of the channel statistics.',

	{'abstract': u'In many applications, nodes in a network desire not only a consensus, but an optimal one. To date, a family of subgradient algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem under general convexity assumptions. This paper shows that, for the scalar case and by assuming a bit more, novel non-gradient-based algorithms with appealing features can be constructed. Specifically, we develop Pairwise Equalizing (PE) and Pairwise Bisectioning (PB), two gossip algorithms that solve unconstrained, separable, convex consensus optimization problems over undirected networks with time-varying topologies, where each local function is strictly convex, continuously differentiable, and has a minimizer. We show that PE and PB are easy to implement, bypass limitations of the subgradient algorithms, and produce switched, nonlinear, networked dynamical systems that admit a common Lyapunov function and asymptotically converge. Moreover, PE generalizes the well-known Pairwise Averaging and Randomized Gossip Algorithm, while PB relaxes a requirement of PE, allowing nodes to never share their local functions.',

	{'abstract': u'We come up with a class of distributed quantized averaging algorithms on asynchronous communication networks with fixed, switching and random topologies. The implementation of these algorithms is subject to the realistic constraint that the communication rate, the memory capacities of agents and the computation precision are finite. The focus of this paper is on the study of the convergence time of the proposed quantized averaging algorithms. By appealing to random walks on graphs, we derive polynomial bounds on the expected convergence time of the algorithms presented.',

	{'abstract': u'Mode-locking regions (resonance tongues) formed by border-collision bifurcations of piecewise-smooth, continuous maps commonly exhibit a distinctive sausage-like geometry with pinch points called "shrinking points". In this paper we extend our unfolding of the piecewise-linear case [, 22(5):1123-1144, 2009] to show how shrinking points are destroyed by nonlinearity. We obtain a codimension-three unfolding of this shrinking point bifurcation for -dimensional maps. We show that the destruction of the shrinking points generically occurs by the creation of a curve of saddle-node bifurcations that smooth one boundary of the sausage, leaving a kink in the other boundary.',

When K=R^n and d is even, we show that its boundary lies on the irreducible hypersurface defined by the discriminant of a single polynomial. When K is a real algebraic variety, we show that P_d(K) lies on the hypersurface defined by the discriminant of several polynomials. When K is a general semialgebraic set, we show that P_d(K) lies on a union of hypersurfaces defined by the discriminantal equations. Explicit formulae for the degrees of these hypersurfaces and discriminants are given. We also prove that typically P_d(K) does not have a log-polynomial type barrier, but a log-semialgebraic type barrier exits. Some illustrating examples are shown.',

	{'abstract': u'A very useful fact in additive combinatorics is that analytic expressions that can be used to count the number of structures of various kinds in subsets of Abelian groups are robust under quasirandom perturbations, and moreover that quasirandomness can often be measured by means of certain easily described norms, known as uniformity norms. However, determining which uniformity norms work for which structures turns out to be a surprisingly hard question. In [GW09a] and [GW09b, GW09c] we gave a complete answer to this question for groups of the form , provided is not too small. In , substantial extra difficulties arise, of which the most important is that an "inverse theorem" even for the uniformity norm requires a more sophisticated (local) formulation. When is prime, is not rich in subgroups, so one must use regular Bohr neighbourhoods instead. In this paper, we prove the first non-trivial case of the main conjecture from [GW09a].',

An important property of the equation is the mass conservation. The fifth-order WENO scheme is built to preserve the total mass of proteins along time.',

By solving the equations analytically, we derive the relation between the average car density and the average car flow, known as the fundamental diagram of traffic. First, we present a model based on min-plus algebra, then we extend it to a stochastic dynamic programming model, then to a stochastic game model. The average car flow is derived as the average cost per time unit of optimal control problems, obtained in terms of the average car density. The models presented in this article can also be seen as developed versions of the car-following model. The derivations proposed here can be used to approximate, understand and interprete fundamental diagrams derived from real measurements.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the large-time behaviour of the solutions of the evolution equation involving nonlinear diffusion and gradient absorption, partial_t u - Delta_p u + | nabla u|^q=0 . We consider the problem posed for and t&gt;0 with nonnegative and compactly supported initial data. We take the exponent p&gt;2 which corresponds to slow p-Laplacian diffusion. The main feature of the paper is that the exponent q takes the critical value q=p-1 which leads to interesting asymptotics. This is due to the fact that in this case both the Hamilton-Jacobi term and the diffusive term have a similar size for large times. The study performed in this paper shows that a delicate asymptotic equilibrium happens, so that the large-time behaviour of the solutions is described by a rescaled version of a suitable self-similar solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation , with logarithmic time corrections. The asymptotic rescaled profile is a kind of sandpile with a cusp on top, and it is independent of the space dimension.',

	{'abstract': u"Supmech, which is noncommutative Hamiltonian mechanics linebreak (NHM) (developed in paper I) with two extra ingredients : positive observable valued measures (PObVMs) [which serve to connect state-induced expectation values and classical probabilities] and the `CC condition' [which stipulates that the sets of observables and pure states be mutually separating] is proposed as a universal mechanics potentially covering all physical phenomena. It facilitates development of an autonomous formalism for quantum mechanics. Quantum systems, defined algebraically as supmech Hamiltonian systems with non-supercommutative system algebras, are shown to inevitably have Hilbert space based realizations (so as to accommodate rigged Hilbert space based Dirac bra-ket formalism), generally admitting commutative superselection rules. Traditional features of quantum mechanics of finite particle systems appear naturally. A treatment of localizability much simpler and more general than the traditional one is given. Treating massive particles as localizable elementary quantum systems, the Schrdinger wave functions with traditional Born interpretation appear as natural objects for the description of their pure states and the Schrdinger equation for them is obtained without ever using a classical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. A provisional set of axioms for the supmech program is given.",

We reduce the problem to a one-dimensional weighted minimization problem on an interval. In a sense, the corresponding extremal polynomials are uniform counterparts of the classical orthogonal Jacobi polynomials. They can be represented by means of special conformal mappings on the so-called comb-like domains. In these terms, the value of the minimal deviation and the representation for a polynomial of best approximation for the original problem are given.

	{'abstract': u'Let be an iterated function system (IFS) on with attractor . Let denote the one-sided full shift over the alphabet . We define the projection entropy function on the space of invariant measures on associated with the coding map , and develop some basic ergodic properties about it. This concept turns out to be crucial in the study of dimensional properties of invariant measures on . We show that for any conformal IFS (resp., the direct product of finitely many conformal IFS), without any separation condition, the projection of an ergodic measure under is always exactly dimensional and, its Hausdorff dimension can be represented as the ratio of its projection entropy to its Lyapunov exponent (resp., the linear combination of projection entropies associated with several coding maps). Furthermore, for any conformal IFS and certain affine IFS, we prove a variational principle between the Hausdorff dimension of the attractors and that of projections of ergodic measures.',

	{'abstract': u'A few years ago Selivanova gave an existence proof for some integrable models, in fact geodesic flows on two dimensional manifolds, with a cubic first integral. However the explicit form of these models hinged on the solution of a nonlinear third order ordinary differential equation which could not be obtained. We show that an appropriate choice of coordinates allows for integration and gives the explicit local form for the full family of integrable systems. The relevant metrics are described by a finite number of parameters and lead to a large class of models on the manifolds and containing as special cases examples due to Goryachev, Chaplygin, Dullin, Matveev and Tsiganov.',

	{'abstract': u"A scheme for rapidly and accurately computing solutions to boundary integral equations (BIEs) on rotationally symmetric surfaces in three dimensions is presented. The scheme uses the Fourier transform to reduce the original BIE defined on a surface to a sequence of BIEs defined on a generating curve for the surface. It can handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally symmetric. Nystrom discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the generating curve. The quadrature used is a high-order Gaussian rule that is modified near the diagonal to retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels. The reduction in dimensionality, along with the use of high-order accurate quadratures, leads to small linear systems that can be inverted directly via, e.g., Gaussian elimination. This makes the scheme particularly fast in environments involving multiple right hand sides. It is demonstrated that for BIEs associated with Laplace's equation, the kernel in the reduced equations can be evaluated very rapidly by exploiting recursion relations for Legendre functions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the scheme; in particular, it is demonstrated that for a BIE associated with Laplace's equation on a surface discretized using 320 000 points, the set-up phase of the algorithm takes 2 minutes on a standard desktop, and then solves can be executed in 0.5 seconds.",

	{'abstract': u'Granular materials will segregate by particle size when subjected to shear, as occurs, for example, in avalanches. The evolution of a bidisperse mixture of particles can be modeled by a nonlinear first order partial differential equation, provided the shear (or velocity) is a known function of position. While avalanche-driven shear is approximately uniform in depth, boundary-driven shear typically creates a shear band with a nonlinear velocity profile. In this paper, we measure a velocity profile from experimental data and solve initial value problems that mimic the segregation observed in the experiment, thereby verifying the value of the continuum model. To simplify the analysis, we consider only one-dimensional configurations, in which a layer of small particles is placed above a layer of large particles within an annular shear cell and is sheared for arbitrarily long times. We fit the measured velocity profile to both an exponential function of depth and a piecewise linear function which separates the shear band from the rest of the material. Each solution of the initial value problem is non-standard, involving curved characteristics in the exponential case, and a material interface with a jump in characteristic speed in the piecewise linear case.',

Conversely, the Cohen-Lyndon Theorem and the Edjvet-Howie Theorem are immediate consequences of the local-indicability Cohen-Lyndon Theorem.

	{'abstract': u'The neighborhood of a pair of vertices in a triple system is the set of vertices such that is an edge. A triple system is semi-bipartite if its vertex set contains a vertex subset such that every edge of intersects in exactly two points. It is easy to see that if is semi-bipartite, then the neighborhood of every pair of vertices in is an independent set. We show a partial converse of this statement by proving that almost all triple systems with vertex sets and independent neighborhoods are semi-bipartite. Our result can be viewed as an extension of the Erd H os-Kleitman-Rothschild theorem to triple systems. The proof uses the Frankl-R "odl hypergraph regularity lemma, and stability theorems.

	{'abstract': u'Secure multi-party computation is a central problem in modern cryptography. An important sub-class of this are problems of the following form: Alice and Bob desire to produce sample(s) of a pair of jointly distributed random variables. Each party must learn nothing more about the other party\'s output than what its own output reveals. To aid in this, they have available a set up - correlated random variables whose distribution is different from the desired distribution - as well as unlimited noiseless communication. In this paper we present an upperbound on how efficiently a given set up can be used to produce samples from a desired distribution. The key tool we develop is a generalization of the concept of common information of two dependent random variables [Gacs-Korner, 1973]. Our generalization - a three-dimensional region - remedies some of the limitations of the original definition which captured only a limited form of dependence. It also includes as a special case Wyner\'s common information [Wyner, 1975]. To derive the cryptographic bounds, we rely on a monotonicity property of this region: the region of the "views" of Alice and Bob engaged in any protocol can only monotonically expand and not shrink. Thus, by comparing the regions for the target random variables and the given random variables, we obtain our upperbound.',

	{'abstract': u'Minimum numbers of fixed points or of coincidence components (realized by maps in given homotopy classes) are the principal objects of study in topological fixed point and coincidence theory. In this paper we investigate fiberwise analoga and represent a general approach e.g. to the question when two maps can be deformed until they are coincidence free. Our method involves normal bordism theory, a certain pathspace EB and a natural generalization of Nielsen numbers. As an illustration we determine the minimum numbers for all maps between torus bundles of arbitrary (possibly different) dimensions over spheres and, in particular, over the unit circle. Our results are based on a careful analysis of the geometry of generic coincidence manifolds. They allow also a simple algebraic description in terms of the Reidemeister invariant (a certain selfmap of an abelian group) and its orbit behavior (e.g. the number of odd order orbits which capture certain nonorientability phenomena). We carry out several explicit sample computations, e.g. for fixed points in (S1)2-bundles. In particular, we obtain existence criteria for fixed point free fiberwise maps.',

Recently, first mathematically rigorous results were obtained on the time-dependent models, e.g. short-in-time well-posedness in the Sobolev space for bounded interactions (C. Lubichand O. Koch with initial data in , in the energy space for Coulomb interactions with initial data in the same space (Trabelsi, Bardos et al., as well as global well-posedness under a sufficient condition on the energy of the initial data (Bardos et al.). The present contribution extends the analysis by setting an theory for the MCTDHF for general interactions including the Coulomb case.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we compare the performance of two scenario-based numerical methods to solve stochastic optimal control problems: scenario trees and particles. The problem consists in finding strategies to control a dynamical system perturbed by exogenous noises so as to minimize some expected cost along a discrete and finite time horizon. We introduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE) which is the expected -distance between the strategy given by the algorithm and the optimal strategy, as a performance indicator for the two models. We study the behaviour of the MSE with respect to the number of scenarios used for discretization. The first model, widely studied in the Stochastic Programming community, consists in approximating the noise diffusion using a scenario tree representation. On a numerical example, we observe that the number of scenarios needed to obtain a given precision grows exponentially with the time horizon. In that sense, our conclusion on scenario trees is equivalent to the one in the work by Shapiro (2006) and has been widely noticed by practitioners. However, in the second part, we show using the same example that, by mixing Stochastic Programming and Dynamic Programming ideas, the particle method described by Carpentier et al (2009) copes with this numerical difficulty: the number of scenarios needed to obtain a given precision now does not depend on the time horizon. Unfortunately, we also observe that serious obstacles still arise from the system state space dimension.',

	{'abstract': u"The capacity region of the N-sender Gaussian multiple access channel with feedback is not known in general. This paper studies the class of linear-feedback codes that includes (nonlinear) nonfeedback codes at one extreme and the linear-feedback codes by Schalkwijk and Kailath, Ozarow, and Kramer at the other extreme. The linear-feedback sum-capacity C_L(N,P) under symmetric power constraints P is characterized, the maximum sum-rate achieved by linear-feedback codes when each sender has the equal block power constraint P. In particular, it is shown that Kramer's code achieves this linear-feedback sum-capacity. The proof involves the dependence balance condition introduced by Hekstra and Willems and extended by Kramer and Gastpar, and the analysis of the resulting nonconvex optimization problem via a Lagrange dual formulation. Finally, an observation is presented based on the properties of the conditional maximal correlation---an extension of the Hirschfeld--Gebelein--Renyi maximal correlation---which reinforces the conjecture that Kramer's code achieves not only the linear-feedback sum-capacity, but also the sum-capacity itself (the maximum sum-rate achieved by arbitrary feedback codes).",

	{'abstract': u"E7 part: In this paper, we study McKay's E7 observation on the Baby Monster. By investigating so called derived c=7/10 Virasoro vectors, we show that there is a natural correspondence between dihedral subgroups of the Baby Monster and certain subalgebras of the Baby Monster vertex operator algebra which are constructed by the nodes of the affine E7 diagram. This allows us to reinterpret McKay's E7 observation via the theory of vertex operator algebras. For a class of vertex operator algebras including the Moonshine module, we will show that the product of two Miyamoto involutions associated to derived c=7/10 Virasoro vectors in certain commutant vertex operator algebras is an element of order at most 4. For the case of the Moonshine module, we obtain the Baby monster vertex operator algebra as the commutant and we can identify the group generated by these Miyamoto involutions with the Baby Monster and recover the -transposition property of the Baby Monster in terms of vertex operator algebras. E6 part: In this paper, we study McKay's E6-observation on the largest Fischer 3-transposition group Fi24. We investigate a vertex operator algebra VF of central charge 23+1/5 on which the Fischer group Fi24 naturally acts. We show that there is a natural correspondence between dihedral subgroups of Fi24 and certain vertex operator subalgebras constructed by the nodes of the affine E6 diagram by investigating so called derived Virasoro vectors of central charge 6/7. This allows us to reinterpret McKay's E6-observation via the theory of vertex operator algebras. It is also shown that the product of two non-commuting Miyamoto involutions of sigma-type associated to derived c=6/7 Virasoro vectors is an element of order 3, under certain general hypotheses on the vertex operator algebra. For the case of VF, we identify these involutions with the 3-transpositions of the Fischer group Fi24.",

	{'abstract': u'We prove weighted anisotropic analytic estimates for solutions of second order elliptic boundary value problems in polyhedra. The weighted analytic classes which we use are the same as those introduced by Guo in 1993 in view of establishing exponential convergence for hp finite element methods in polyhedra. We first give a simple proof of the known weighted analytic regularity in a polygon, relying on a new formulation of elliptic a priori estimates in smooth domains with analytic control of derivatives. The technique is based on dyadic partitions near the corners. This technique can successfully be extended to polyhedra, providing isotropic analytic regularity. This is not optimal, because it does not take advantage of the full regularity along the edges. We combine it with a nested open set technique to obtain the desired three-dimensional anisotropic analytic regularity result. Our proofs are global and do not require the analysis of singular functions.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that if G is a discrete group which does not have the Haagerup property but does have an unbounded cocycle into a C_0 representation and if G acts on a finite von Neumann algebra B such that the inclusion B subset (B rtimes G) has the Haagerup property from below then any group-measure space Cartan subalgebra must have a corner which embeds into B inside B rtimes G. Taking the action to be trivial we produce examples of II_1 factors N such that N otimes M is not a group-measure space construction whenever M is a finite factor with the Haagerup property. Taking the action on a probability space with the Haagerup property from below we produce examples of von Neumann algebras which have unique group-measure space Cartan subalgebras. Taking profinite actions of certain products of groups we use the unique Cartan decomposition theorem of N. Ozawa and S. Popa and the cocycle superrigidity theorem of A. Ioana to produce actions which are virtually W*-superrigid.',

	{'abstract': u'We present new computations of approximately length-minimizing polygons with fixed thickness. These curves model the centerlines of "tight" knotted tubes with minimal length and fixed circular cross-section. Our curves approximately minimize the ropelength (or quotient of length and thickness) for polygons in their knot types. While previous authors have minimized ropelength for polygons using simulated annealing, the new idea in our code is to minimize length over the set of polygons of thickness at least one using a version of constrained gradient descent. We rewrite the problem in terms of minimizing the length of the polygon subject to an infinite family of differentiable constraint functions. We prove that the polyhedral cone of variations of a polygon of thickness one which do not decrease thickness to first order is finitely generated, and give an explicit set of generators. Using this cone we give a first-order minimization procedure and a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker criterion for polygonal ropelength criticality. Our main numerical contribution is a set of 379 almost-critical prime knots and links, covering all prime knots with no more than 10 crossings and all prime links with no more than 9 crossings. For links, these are the first published ropelength figures, and for knots they improve on existing figures. We give new maps of the self-contacts of these knots and links, and discover some highly symmetric tight knots with particularly simple looking self-contact maps.',

	{'abstract': u'The direct sum map Gr(a,n) x Gr(b,m) -&gt; Gr(a+b,m+n) on Grassmannians induces a K-theory pullback that defines the splitting coefficients. We geometrically explain an identity from [Buch \'02] between the splitting coefficients and the Schubert structure constants for products of Schubert structure sheaves. This is related to the topic of product and splitting coefficients for Schubert boundary ideal sheaves. Our main results extend jeu de taquin for increasing tableaux [Thomas-Yong \'09] by proving transparent analogues of [Sch "tzenberger \'77]\'s fundamental theorems on well-definedness of rectification. We then establish that jeu de taquin gives rules for each of these four kinds of coefficients.',

This paper investigates power quasi-symmetric homeomorphisms between bounded, complete, uniformly perfect, ultrametric spaces (i.e., those ultrametric spaces arising up to similarity as the end spaces of bushy trees). A bounded distortion property is found that characterizes power quasi-symmetric homeomorphisms between such ultrametric spaces that are also pseudo-doubling. Moreover, examples are given showing the extent to which the power quasi-symmetry of homeomorphisms is not captured by the quasiconformal and bi-H "older conditions for this class of ultrametric spaces.',

Thus, we show that for a fairly arbitrary open stable differential relation , the machinery of stable homotopy theory can be applied to perform explicit computations and determine invariants of solutions. In the case of the differential relation whose solutions are all maps, our construction amounts to the Pontrjagin-Thom construction. In the case of the covering differential relation our result is equivalent to the Barratt-Priddy-Quillen theorem asserting that the direct limit of classifying spaces of permutation groups of finite sets of n elements is homology equivalent to each path component of the infinite loop space . In the case of the submersion differential relation imposed on maps of dimension the cohomology theories and are not equivalent.

This approach is naturally asymptotic preserving, and allows for the presence of vacuum. Even if the mesh size and the time step do not depend on the Planck constant, we recover the position and current densities in the semiclassical limit, with a numerical rate of convergence in accordance with the theoretical results, before shocks appear in the limiting Euler equation. By using simple projections, the mass and the momentum of the solution are well preserved by the numerical scheme, while the variation of the energy is not negligible numerically. Experiments suggest that beyond the critical time for the Euler equation, Grenier's approach yields smooth but highly oscillatory terms.",

	{'abstract': u'We study the arithmetic of Enriques surfaces whose universal covers are singular K3 surfaces. If a singular K3 surface X has discriminant d, then it has a model over the ring class field d. Our main theorem is that the same holds true for any Enriques quotient of X. It is based on a study on Neron-Severi groups of singular K3 surfaces. We also comment on Galois actions on divisors of Enriques surfaces.',

Such a braided variety is called regular if there exists a projective module on it, which is a counterpart of the cotangent bundle on a generic orbit O in gl(m)* in the framework of the Serre approach. We give a criterium of regularity of a braided orbit in terms of roots of the Cayley-Hamilton identity valid for the generating matrix of the Reflection Equation Algebra in question.

	{'abstract': u'We investigate power allocation for users in a spectrum underlay cognitive network. Our objective is to find a power control scheme that allocates transmit power for both primary and secondary users so that the overall network throughput is maximized while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) of the primary users greater than a certain minimum limit. Since an optimum solution to our problem is computationally intractable, as the optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an iterative algorithm based on sequential geometric programming, that is proved to converge to at least a local optimum solution. We use the proposed algorithm to show how a spectrum underlay network would achieve higher throughput with secondary users operation than with primary users operating alone. Also, we show via simulations that the loss in primary throughput due to the admission of the secondary users is accompanied by a reduction in the total primary transmit power.',

	{'abstract': u'It is shown that any singular Lagrangian theory: 1) can be formulated without the use of constraints by introducing a Clairaut-type version of the Hamiltonian formalism; 2) leads to a special kind of nonabelian gauge theory which is similar to the Poisson gauge theory; 3) can be treated as the many-time classical dynamics. A generalization of the Legendre transform to the zero Hessian case is done by using the mixed (envelope/general) solution of the multidimensional Clairaut equation. The corresponding system of motion equations is equivalent to the Lagrange equations and has a linear algebraic subsystem for "unresolved" velocities. Then the equations of motion are written in the Hamilton-like form by introducing new antisymmetric brackets. This is a "shortened" formalism, since it does not contain the "nondynamical" (degenerate) momenta at all, and therefore there is no notion of constraint. It is outlined that any classical degenerate Lagrangian theory (in its Clairaut-type Hamiltonian form) is equivalent to the many-time classical dynamics. Finally, the relation between the presented formalism and the Dirac approach to constrained systems is given.',

	{'abstract': u'The geometry of unit -dimensional balls has been intensively investigated in the past decades. A particular topic of interest has been the study of the asymptotics of their projections. Apart from their intrinsic interest, such questions have applications in several probabilistic and geometric contexts (Barthe et al. 2005). In this paper, our aim is to revisit some known results of this flavour with a new point of view. Roughly speaking, we will endow the ball with some kind of Dirichlet distribution that generalizes the uniform one and will follow the method developed in Skibinsky (1967), Chang et al. (1993) in the context of the randomized moment space. The main idea is to build a suitable coordinate change involving independent random variables. Moreover, we will shed light on a nice connection between the randomized balls and the randomized moment space.',

Since boundary integral equations are a classical tool to solve electromagnetic scattering problems, we study the shape differentiability properties of the standard electromagnetic boundary integral operators. Using Helmholtz decomposition, we can base their analysis on the study of scalar integral operators in standard Sobolev spaces, but we then have to study the G ^ateaux differentiability of surface differential operators. We prove that the electromagnetic boundary integral operators are infinitely differentiable without loss of regularity and that the solutions of the scattering problem are infinitely shape differentiable away from the boundary of the obstacle, whereas their derivatives lose regularity on the boundary.

	{'abstract': u'The Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) with transmit antennas and single-antenna users is considered for the case in which the channel state information is obtained at the transmitter via a finite-rate feedback link of capacity bits per user. The throughput (i.e., the sum-rate normalized by ) of the GBC is analyzed in the limit as with . Considering the transmission strategy of zeroforcing dirty paper coding (ZFDPC), a closed-form expression for the asymptotic throughput is derived. It is observed that, even under the finite-rate feedback setting, ZFDPC achieves a significantly higher throughput than zeroforcing beamforming. Using the asymptotic throughput expression, the problem of obtaining the number of users to be selected in order to maximize the throughput is solved.',

Nevertheless, history shows that the finite difference equation is primitive and that the differential equation is its idealized representation designed to obtain solutions in algebraic form. The difference equation is logically consistent within itself, independent of the differential equation. The difference equation and the differential equation together constitute two powerful complementary tools, one providing numerical solutions to problems of arbitrary complexity on a case by case basis, and the other providing insights into classes of problems under idealized conditions.',

One of the most fundamental properties of definable sets is that a compact definable set in R^n is definably homeomorphic to a polyhedron (see [v]). We show uniqueness of the polyhedron up to PL homeomorphisms (o-minimal Hauptvermutung).

	{'abstract': u'It is proved that the information divergence statistic is infinitely more Bahadur efficient than the power divergence statistics of the orders as long as the sequence of alternatives is contiguous with respect to the sequence of null-hypotheses and the the number of observations per bin increases to infinity is not very slow. This improves the former result in Harremo "es and Vajda (2008) where the the sequence of null-hypotheses was assumed to be uniform and the restrictions on on the numbers of observations per bin were sharper. Moreover, this paper evaluates also the Bahadur efficiency of the power divergence statistics of the remaining positive orders The statistics of these orders are mutually Bahadur-comparable and all of them are more Bahadur efficient than the statistics of the orders A detailed discussion of the technical definitions and conditions is given, some unclear points are resolved, and the results are illustrated by examples.',

	{'abstract': u'A book of size b in a graph is an edge that lies in b triangles. Consider a graph G with n vertices and lfloor n^2/4 rfloor +1 edges. Rademacher proved that G contains at least lfloor n/2 rfloor triangles, and Erdos conjectured and Edwards proved that G contains a book of size at least n/6. We prove the following "linear combination" of these two results. Suppose that alpha in (1/2, 1) and the maximum size of a book in G is less than alpha n/2. Then G contains at least alpha(1- alpha) n^2/4 - o(n^2) triangles as n approaches infinity. This is asymptotically sharp. On the other hand, for every alpha in (1/3, 1/2), there exists beta&gt;0 such that G contains at least beta n^3 triangles. It remains an open problem to determine the largest possible beta in terms of alpha. Our proof uses the Ruzsa-Szemeredi theorem.',

	{'abstract': u'Mathematical models for the description, in a quantitative way, of the damages induced on the monuments by the action of specific pollutants are often systems of nonlinear, possibly degenerate, parabolic equations. Although some the asymptotic properties of the solutions are known, for a short window of time, one needs a numerical approximation scheme in order to have a quantitative forecast at any time of interest. In this paper a fully implicit numerical method is proposed, analyzed and numerically tested for parabolic equations of porous media type and on a systems of two PDEs that models the sulfation of marble in monuments. Due to the nonlinear nature of the underlying mathematical model, the use of a fixed point scheme is required and every step implies the solution of large, locally structured, linear systems. A special effort is devoted to the spectral analysis of the relevant matrices and to the design of appropriate iterative or multi-iterative solvers, with special attention to preconditioned Krylov methods and to multigrid procedures. Numerical experiments for the validation of the analysis complement this contribution.',

After surveying algorithms for computing the global b-function, we develop a new method to compute the local b-function for a single polynomial. We then develop algorithms that compute generalized Bernstein-Sato polynomials of Budur-Mustata-Saito and Shibuta for an arbitrary polynomial ideal. These lead to computations of log canonical thresholds, jumping coefficients, and multiplier ideals. Our algorithm for multiplier ideals simplifies that of Shibuta and shares a common subroutine with our local b-function algorithm.

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of data exchange by a group of closely-located wireless nodes. In this problem each node holds a set of packets and needs to obtain all the packets held by other nodes. Each of the nodes can broadcast the packets in its possession (or a combination thereof) via a noiseless broadcast channel of capacity one packet per channel use. The goal is to minimize the total number of transmissions needed to satisfy the demands of all the nodes, assuming that they can cooperate with each other and are fully aware of the packet sets available to other nodes. This problem arises in several practical settings, such as peer-to-peer systems and wireless data broadcast. In this paper, we establish upper and lower bounds on the optimal number of transmissions and present an efficient algorithm with provable performance guarantees. The effectiveness of our algorithms is established through numerical simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'The two-dimensional, periodic Lorentz gas, is the dynamical system corresponding with the free motion of a point particle in a planar system of fixed circular obstacles centered at the vertices of a square lattice in the Euclidian plane. Assuming elastic collisions between the particle and the obstacles, this dynamical system is studied in the Boltzmann-Grad limit, assuming that the obstacle radius and the reciprocal mean free path are asymptotically equivalent small quantities, and that the particle\'s distribution function is slowly varying in the space variable. In this limit, the periodic Lorentz gas cannot be described by a linear Boltzmann equation (see [F. Golse, Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse 17 (2008), 735--749]), but involves an integro-differential equation conjectured in [E. Caglioti, F. Golse, C.R. Acad. Sci. S \'er. I Math. 346 (2008) 477--482] and proved in [J. Marklof, A. Str "ombergsson, preprint arXiv:0801.0612], set on a phase-space larger than the usual single-particle phase-space. The main purpose of the present paper is to study the dynamical properties of this integro-differential equation: identifying its equilibrium states, proving a H Theorem and discussing the speed of approach to equilibrium in the long time limit. In the first part of the paper, we derive the explicit formula for a transition probability appearing in that equation following the method sketched in [E. Caglioti, F. Golse, loc. cit.].',

	{'abstract': u'Looking at the cartesian product of a topological space with itself, a natural map to be considered on that object is the involution that interchanges the coordinates, i.e. that maps (x,y) to (y,x). The so-called halfsquaring construction, now also called "symmetric squaring construction", in Cech homology with Z/2-coefficients was introduced in [arXiv:0709.1774] as a map from the k-th Cech homology group of a space X to the 2k-th Cech homology group of X times X divided by the above mentioned involution. It turns out to be a crucial construction in the proof of a Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem. In this thesis, a generalization of this construction, which is here called "Dachabbildung", to Cech homology with integer coefficients is given for even dimensions k, which is proven to equally satisfy the useful properties of the original construction. Detailed proofs are provided which could also supersede the somewhat sketchy exposition of [arXiv:0709.1774] for the case of Z/2-coefficients. As a preparation for the presented results, two possibilities of defining Cech homology are closely examined and shown to be ismorphic.',

	{'abstract': u'Active Constellation Extension (ACE) is one of techniques introduced for Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) reduction for OFDM systems. In this technique, the constellation points are extended such that the PAPR is minimized but the minimum distance of the constellation points does not decrease. In this paper, an iterative ACE method is extended to spatially encoded OFDM systems. The proposed methods are such that the PAPR is reduced simultaneously at all antennas, while the spatial encoding relationships still hold. It will be shown that the original ACE method can be employed before Space Time Block Coding (STBC). But in case of Space Frequency Block Coding (SFBC), two modified techniques have been proposed. In the first method, the OFDM frame is separated by several subframes and the ACE method is applied to these subframes independently to reduce their corresponding PAPRs. Then the low PAPR subframes are recombined based on SFBC relationships to yield the transmitted signals from different antennas. In the second method, for each iteration, the ACE is applied to the antenna with the maximum PAPR, and the signals of the other antennas are generated from that of this antenna. Simulation results show that both algorithms converge, but the second method outperforms the first one when the number of antennas is increased.',

	{'abstract': u'The thirteen spheres problem is asking if 13 equal size nonoverlapping spheres in three dimensions can touch another sphere of the same size. This problem was the subject of the famous discussion between Isaac Newton and David Gregory in 1694. The problem was solved by Schutte and van der Waerden only in 1953. A natural extension of this problem is the strong thirteen spheres problem (or the Tammes problem for 13 points) which asks to find an arrangement and the maximum radius of 13 equal size nonoverlapping spheres touching the unit sphere. In the paper we give a solution of this long-standing open problem in geometry. Our computer-assisted proof is based on a enumeration of the so-called irreducible graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the local rank-modulation scheme in which a sliding window going over a sequence of real-valued variables induces a sequence of permutations. The local rank-modulation, as a generalization of the rank-modulation scheme, has been recently suggested as a way of storing information in flash memory. We study constant-weight Gray codes for the local rank-modulation scheme in order to simulate conventional multi-level flash cells while retaining the benefits of rank modulation. We provide necessary conditions for the existence of cyclic and cyclic optimal Gray codes. We then specifically study codes of weight 2 and upper bound their efficiency, thus proving that there are no such asymptotically-optimal cyclic codes. In contrast, we study codes of weight 3 and efficiently construct codes which are asymptotically-optimal.',

	{'abstract': u'A Mustafin variety is a degeneration of projective space induced by a point configuration in a Bruhat-Tits building. The special fiber is reduced and Cohen-Macaulay, and its irreducible components form interesting combinatorial patterns. For configurations that lie in one apartment, these patterns are regular mixed subdivisions of scaled simplices, and the Mustafin variety is a twisted Veronese variety built from such a subdivision. This connects our study to tropical and toric geometry. For general configurations, the irreducible components of the special fiber are rational varieties, and any blow-up of projective space along a linear subspace arrangement can arise. A detailed study of Mustafin varieties is undertaken for configurations in the Bruhat-Tits tree of PGL(2) and in the two-dimensional building of PGL(3). The latter yields the classification of Mustafin triangles into 38 combinatorial types.',

	{'abstract': u'Coding over subsets (known as generations) rather than over all content blocks in P2P distribution networks and other applications is necessary for a number of practical reasons such as computational complexity. A penalty for coding only within generations is an overall throughput reduction. It has been previously shown that allowing contiguous generations to overlap in a head-to-toe manner improves the throughput. We here propose and study a scheme, referred to as the , that creates shared packets between any two generations at random rather than only the neighboring ones. By optimizing very few design parameters, we obtain a simple scheme that outperforms both the non-overlapping and the head-to-toe overlapping schemes of comparable computational complexity, both in the expected throughput and in the rate of convergence of the probability of decoding failure to zero. We provide a practical algorithm for accurate analysis of the expected throughput of the random annex code for finite-length information. This algorithm enables us to quantify the throughput vs.computational complexity tradeoff, which is necessary for optimal selection of the scheme parameters.',

A penalty is throughput reduction. We model coding over generations as the coupon collector's brotherhood problem. This model enables us to theoretically compute the expected number of coded packets needed for successful decoding of the entire content, as well as a bound on the probability of decoding failure, and further, to quantify the tradeoff between computational complexity and throughput. Interestingly, with a moderate increase in the generation size, throughput quickly approaches link capacity.

Recently, a new class of methods, named "Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods (HBVMs)" has been introduced and analysed, which are able to exactly preserve polynomial Hamiltonians of arbitrarily high degree. We here study a further property of such methods, namely that of having, when cast as Runge-Kutta methods, a matrix of the Butcher tableau with the same spectrum (apart the zero eigenvalues) as that of the corresponding Gauss-Legendre method, independently of the considered abscissae. Consequently, HBVMs are always perfectly A-stable methods. Moreover, this allows their efficient "blended" implementation, for solving the generated discrete problems.',

	{'abstract': u'Wigner and Husimi transforms have long been used for the phase-space reformulation of Schr "odinger-type equations, and the study of the corresponding semiclassical limits. Most of the existing results provide approximations in appropriate weak topologies. In this work we are concerned with semiclassical limits in the strong topology, i.e. approximation of Wigner functions by solutions of the Liouville equation in and Sobolev norms. The results obtained improve the state of the art, and highlight the role of potential regularity, especially through the regularity of the Wigner equation. It must be mentioned that the strong convergence can be shown up to time-scales, which is well known to be, in general, the limit of validity of semiclassical asymptotics.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we characterize the information-theoretic capacity scaling of wireless ad hoc networks with randomly distributed nodes. By using an exact channel model from Maxwell\'s equations, we successfully resolve the conflict in the literature between the linear capacity scaling by "zg "r et al. and the degrees of freedom limit given as the ratio of the network diameter and the wavelength by Franceschetti et al. In dense networks where the network area is fixed, the capacity scaling is given as the minimum of and the degrees of freedom limit to within an arbitrarily small exponent. In extended networks where the network area is linear in , the capacity scaling is given as the minimum of and the degrees of freedom limit to within an arbitrarily small exponent. Hence, we recover the linear capacity scaling by "zg "r et al. if in dense networks and if in extended networks. Otherwise, the capacity scaling is given as the degrees of freedom limit characterized by Franceschetti et al. For achievability, a modified hierarchical cooperation is proposed based on a lower bound on the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output channel between two node clusters using our channel model.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper we study the problem of half-duplex active eavesdropping in fast fading channels. The active eavesdropper is a more powerful adversary than the classical eavesdropper. It can choose between two functional modes: eavesdropping the transmission between the legitimate parties (Ex mode), and jamming it (Jx mode) -- the active eavesdropper cannot function in full duplex mode. We consider a conservative scenario, when the active eavesdropper can choose its strategy based on the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair's strategy -- and thus the transmitter and legitimate receiver have to plan for the worst. We show that conventional physical-layer secrecy approaches perform poorly (if at all), and we introduce a novel encoding scheme, based on very limited and unsecured feedback -- the Block-Markov Wyner (BMW) encoding scheme -- which outperforms any schemes currently available.",

	{'abstract': u'The LASSO is a widely used statistical methodology for simultaneous estimation and variable selection. In the last years, many authors analyzed this technique from a theoretical and applied point of view. We introduce and study the adaptive LASSO problem for discretely observed ergodic diffusion processes. We prove oracle properties also deriving the asymptotic distribution of the LASSO estimator. Our theoretical framework is based on the random field approach and it applied to more general families of regular statistical experiments in the sense of Ibragimov-Hasminskii (1981). Furthermore, we perform a simulation and real data analysis to provide some evidence on the applicability of this method.',

Topological defects in such minimizers correspond to the zeros of the corresponding equilibrium field. We consider two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains separately and study the correspondence between Landau-de Gennes theory and Ginzburg-Landau theory for superconductors. We obtain results for the location and dimensionality of the defect set, the minimizer profile near the defect set and study the qualitative properties of uniaxial energy minimizers away from the defect set, in the physically relevant case of vanishing elastic constant. In the three-dimensional case, we establish the -convergence of uniaxial minimizers to a limiting harmonic map, away from the defect set, for some . Some generalizations for biaxial minimizers are also discussed. This work is motivated by the study of defects in liquid crystalline systems and their applications.',

	{'abstract': u'Consider an i.i.d. sequence of random variables whose distribution f* lies in one of a nested family of models M_q, q&gt;=1. The smallest index q* such that M_ contains f* is called the model order. We establish strong consistency of the penalized likelihood order estimator in a general setting with penalties of order eta(q) log log n, where eta(q) is a dimensional quantity. Moreover, such penalties are shown to be minimal. In contrast to previous work, an a priori upper bound on the model order is not assumed. The results rely on a sharp characterization of the pathwise fluctuations of the generalized likelihood ratio statistic under entropy assumptions on the model classes. Our results are applied to the geometrically complex problem of location mixture order estimation, which is widely used but poorly understood.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the asymptotic behavior corresponding to the arbitrary high conductivity of the heat in the thermoelectric devices. This work deals with a steady-state multidimensional thermistor problem, considering the Joule effect and both spatial and temperature dependent transport coefficients under some real boundary conditions in accordance with the Seebeck-Peltier-Thomson cross-effects. Our first purpose is that the existence of a weak solution holds true under minimal assumptions on the data, as in particular nonsmooth domains. Two existence results are studied under different assumptions on the electrical conductivity. Their proofs are based on a fixed point argument, compactness methods, and existence and regularity theory for elliptic scalar equations. The second purpose is to show the existence of a limit model illustrating the asymptotic situation.',

We also characterize in a simple manner the corresponding Schroder paths under a bijection of Egge and Mansour.

In a similar manner, centrosymmetric involutions avoiding these same patterns are shown to be enumerated by the Pell numbers.',

We consider closed systems characterized by a slowly varying time-dependent Hamiltonian depending on an external parameter . The current operator, defined as the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to , once integrated over some time interval, gives rise to a charge pumped through the system over that time span. We determine the first two leading terms in the adiabatic parameter of this pumped charge under the usual gap hypothesis. In particular, in case the Hamiltonian is time periodic and has discrete non-degenerate spectrum, the charge pumped over a period is given to leading order by the derivative with respect to of the corresponding dynamical and geometric phases.',

Conifolds are a key ingredient in the compactification problem for moduli spaces of compact SLs in Calabi-Yau manifolds. This category allows for the simultaneous presence of conical singularities and of non-compact, asymptotically conical, ends. Our main theorem is the natural next step in the chain of results initiated by McLean and continued by the author and by Joyce. We emphasize a unifying framework for studying the various cases and discuss analogies and differences between them.

	{'abstract': u'This paper is a self-contained presentation of certain aspects of the theory of weighted Sobolev spaces and elliptic operators on non-compact Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we discuss (i) the standard and weighted Sobolev Embedding Theorems for general manifolds and (ii) Fredholm results for elliptic operators on manifolds with a finite number of ends modelled either on cones ("conifolds") or on cylinders. As an application of these results we present a detailed analysis of certain spaces of harmonic functions on conifolds. Some of the results presented here are of course well-known. Some others are probably known or self-evident to the experts. However, the current literature is not always easy to understand and is often sketchy, apparently not covering some aspects and consequences of the general theory which are useful in applications. In particular, in recent years results of this type have played an increasing role in Differential Geometry. The goal of this paper is thus to fill certain gaps in the current literature and to make these results available to a wider audience. The paper is also meant as a companion paper to the author\'s forthcoming articles [8],[9]. From this point of view it is still incomplete: future versions of this paper will incorporate more material, giving particular attention to uniform elliptic estimates for certain parametric connect sum constructions.',

In the present work, we aim at providing an original example of application of this principle in the framework of random matrix theory. More specifically, by combining the result in [25] with some combinatorial estimates, we are able to prove multi-dimensional central limit theorems for the spectral moments (of arbitrary degrees) associated with random matrices with real-valued i.i.d. entries, satisfying some appropriate moment conditions. Our approach has the advantage of yielding, without extra effort, bounds over classes of smooth (i.e., thrice differentiable) functions, and it allows to deal directly with discrete distributions. As a further application of our estimates, we provide a new "almost sure central limit theorem", involving logarithmic means of functions of vectors of traces.',

	{'abstract': u'In order to achieve fault tolerance, highly reliable system often require the ability to detect errors as soon as they occur and prevent the speared of erroneous information throughout the system. Thus, the need for codes capable of detecting and correcting byte errors are extremely important since many memory systems use b-bit-per-chip organization. Redundancy on the chip must be put to make fault-tolerant design available. This paper examined several methods of computer memory systems, and then a proposed technique is designed to choose a suitable method depending on the organization of memory systems. The constructed codes require a minimum number of check bits with respect to codes used previously, then it is optimized to fit the organization of memory systems according to the requirements for data and byte lengths.',

	{'abstract': u'This article investigates unsupervised classification techniques for categorical multivariate data. The study employs multivariate multinomial mixture modeling, which is a type of model particularly applicable to multilocus genotypic data. A model selection procedure is used to simultaneously select the number of components and the relevant variables. A non-asymptotic oracle inequality is obtained, leading to the proposal of a new penalized maximum likelihood criterion. The selected model proves to be asymptotically consistent under weak assumptions on the true probability underlying the observations. The main theoretical result obtained in this study suggests a penalty function defined to within a multiplicative parameter. In practice, the data-driven calibration of the penalty function is made possible by slope heuristics. Based on simulated data, this procedure is found to improve the performance of the selection procedure with respect to classical criteria such as BIC and AIC. The new criterion provides an answer to the question "Which criterion for which sample size?" Examples of real dataset applications are also provided.',

	{'abstract': u'Let M be a compact manifold of dimension n, P = P(h) a semiclassical pseudodifferential operator on M, and u = u(h) an L^2 normalised family of functions such that Pu is O(h) in L^2(M) as h goes to 0. Let H be a compact submanifold of M. In a previous article, the second-named author proved estimates on the L^p norms, p &gt; 2, of u restricted to H, under the assumption that the u are semiclassically localised and under some natural structural assumptions about the principal symbol of P. These estimates are of the form Ch^d(n;k;p) where k=dimH (except for a logarithmic divergence in the case k = n-2; p = 2). When H is a hypersurface, i.e. k = n-1, we have d(n;n-1;2)=1/4, which is sharp when M is the round n-sphere and H is an equator. In this article, we assume that H is a hypersurface, and make the additional geometric assumption that H is curved with respect to the bicharacteristic flow of P. Under this assumption we improve the estimate from d=1/4 to 1/6, generalising work of Burq-Gerard-Tzvetkov and Hu for Laplace eigenfunctions. To do this we apply the Melrose-Taylor theorem, as adapted by Pan and Sogge, for Fourier integral operators with folding canonical relations.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, Hermite polynomials related to quantum systems with orthogonal O(m)-symmetry, finite reflection group symmetry G &lt; O(m), symplectic symmetry Sp(2n) and superspace symmetry O(m) x Sp(2n) are considered. After an overview of the results for O(m) and G, the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials related to Sp(2n) is obtained with respect to the Berezin integral. As a consequence, an extension of the Mehler formula for the classical Hermite polynomials to Grassmann algebras is proven. Next, Hermite polynomials in a full superspace with O(m) x Sp(2n) symmetry are considered. It is shown that they are not orthogonal with respect to the canonically defined inner product. However, a new inner product is introduced which behaves correctly with respect to the structure of harmonic polynomials on superspace. This inner product allows to restore the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials and also restores the hermiticity of a class of Schroedinger operators in superspace. Subsequently, a Mehler formula for the full superspace is obtained, thus yielding an eigenfunction decomposition of the super Fourier transform. Finally, an extensive comparison is made of the results in the different types of symmetry.',

	{'abstract': u'In this article we study a partial ordering on knots in the 3-sphere where K_1 is greater than or equal to K_2 if there is an epimorphism from the knot group of K_1 onto the knot group of K_2 which preserves peripheral structure. If K_1 is a 2-bridge knot and K_1 &gt; K_2, then it is known that K_2 must also be 2-bridge. Furthermore, Ohtsuki, Riley, and Sakuma give a construction which, for a given 2-bridge knot K_, produces infinitely 2-bridge knots K_ with K_&gt;K_. After characterizing all 2-bridge knots with 4 or less distinct boundary slopes, we use this to prove that in any such pair, K_ is either a torus knot or has 5 or more distinct boundary slopes. We also prove that 2-bridge knots with exactly 3 distinct boundary slopes are minimal with respect to the partial ordering. This result provides some evidence for the conjecture that all pairs of 2-bridge knots with K_&gt;K_ arise from the Ohtsuki-Riley-Sakuma construction.',

	{'abstract': u'The one-dimensional Hubbard model is an exceptional integrable spin chain which is apparently based on a deformation of the Yangian for the superalgebra gl(2|2). Here we investigate the quantum-deformation of the Hubbard model in the classical limit. This leads to a novel classical r-matrix of trigonometric kind. We derive the corresponding one-parameter family of Lie bialgebras as a deformation of the affine gl(2|2) Kac-Moody superalgebra. In particular, we discuss the affine extension as well as discrete symmetries, and we scan for simpler limiting cases, such as the rational r-matrix for the undeformed Hubbard model.',

Serre gave a strengthening showing that a positive proportion of eigenvalues of any -regular graph must be bigger than . We provide a multipartite version of this result. Our proofs are elementary and work also in the case when graphs are not regular. In the simplest, monopartite case, our result extends the Alon-Boppana-Serre result to non-regular graphs of minimum degree and bounded maximum degree. The two-partite result shows that for every and any positive integers , every -vertex graph of maximum degree at most , whose vertex set is the union of (not necessarily disjoint) subsets , such that every vertex in has at least neighbors in for , has eigenvalues that are larger than . Finally, we strengthen the Alon-Boppana-Serre theorem by showing that the lower bound can be replaced by for some if graphs have bounded "global girth". On the other side of the spectrum, if the odd girth is large, then we get an Alon-Boppana-Serre type theorem for the negative eigenvalues as well.',

	{'abstract': u"Inspired by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, we define the intrinsic flat distance between oriented dimensional Riemannian manifolds with boundary by isometrically embedding the manifolds into a common metric space, measuring the flat distance between them and taking an infimum over all isometric embeddings and all common metric spaces. This is made rigorous by applying Ambrosio-Kirchheim's extension of Federer-Fleming's notion of integral currents to arbitrary metric spaces. We prove the intrinsic flat distance between two compact oriented Riemannian manifolds is zero iff they have an orientation preserving isometry between them. Using the theory of Ambrosio-Kirchheim, we study converging sequences of manifolds and their limits, which are in a class of metric spaces that we call integral current spaces. We describe the properties of such spaces including the fact that they are countably rectifiable spaces and present numerous examples.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper initiates the study of topological arbiters, a concept rooted in Poincare-Lefschetz duality. Given an n-dimensional manifold W, a topological arbiter associates a value 0 or 1 to codimension zero submanifolds of W, subject to natural topological and duality axioms. For example, there is a unique arbiter on , which reports the location of the essential 1-cycle. In contrast, we show that there exists an uncountable collection of topological arbiters in dimension 4. Families of arbiters, not induced by homology, are also shown to exist in higher dimensions. The technical ingredients underlying the four dimensional results are secondary obstructions to generalized link-slicing problems. For classical links in the 3-sphere the construction relies on the existence of nilpotent embedding obstructions in dimension 4, reflected in particular by the Milnor group. In higher dimensions novel arbiters are produced using nontrivial squares in stable homotopy theory. The concept of "topological arbiter" derives from percolation and from 4-dimensional surgery. It is not the purpose of this paper to advance either of these subjects, but rather to study the concept for its own sake. However in appendices we give both an application to percolation, and the current understanding of the relationship between arbiters and surgery. An appendix also introduces a more general notion of a multi-arbiter. Properties and applications are discussed, including a construction of non-homological multi-arbiters.',

	{'abstract': u"Ranking groups of researchers is important in several contexts and can serve many purposes such as the fair distribution of grants based on the scientist's publication output, concession of research projects, classification of journal editorial boards and many other applications in a social context. In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the performance of groups of researchers. The proposed method is called alpha-index and it is based on two parameters: (i) the homogeneity of the h-indexes of the researchers in the group; and (ii) the h-group, which is an extension of the h-index for groups. Our method integrates the concepts of homogeneity and absolute value of the h-index into a single measure which is appropriate for the evaluation of groups. We report on experiments that assess computer science conferences based on the h-indexes of their program committee members. Our results are similar to a manual classification scheme adopted by a research agency.",

The parameters that appear in Hill's equation include the forcing strength and oscillation frequency. The development of the solutions to this periodic differential equation can be described by a discrete map, where the matrix elements are given by the principal solutions for each cycle. Variations in the forcing strength and oscillation frequency lead to matrix elements that vary from cycle to cycle. This paper presents an analysis of the growth rates including cases where all of the cycles are highly unstable, where some cycles are near the stability border, and where the map would be stable in the absence of fluctuations. For all of these regimes, we provide expressions for the growth rates of the matrices that describe the solutions.",

	{'abstract': u'The probability of a quantum particle being detected in a given solid angle is determined by the -matrix. The explanation of this fact in time dependent scattering theory is often linked to the quantum flux, since the quantum flux integrated against a (detector-) surface and over a time interval can be viewed as the probability that the particle crosses this surface within the given time interval. Regarding many particle scattering, however, this argument is no longer valid, as each particle arrives at the detector at its own random time. While various treatments of this problem can be envisaged, here we present a straightforward Bohmian analysis of many particle potential scattering from which the -matrix probability emerges in the limit of large distances.',

	{'abstract': u'We describe representation theorems for local and perfect MV-algebras in terms of ultraproducts involving the unit interval [0,1]. Furthermore, we give a representation of local Abelian lattice-ordered groups with strong unit as quasi-constant functions on an ultraproduct of the reals. All the above theorems are proved to have a uniform version, depending only on the cardinality of the algebra to be embedded, as well as a definable construction in ZFC. The paper contains both known and new results and provides a complete overview of representation theorems for such classes.',

	{'abstract': u'Singularities appear in numerous important mathematical models used in Physics. And in most of such cases singularities are involved in essentially nonlinear contexts. For more than four decades, general enough nonlinear theories of singularities have been developed. A critically important related feature is that, above certain levels in singularities, the operation of multiplication, and in general, nonlinear operations on such singularities do inevitably branch in infinitely many ways, without the possibility for the existence of some unique natural or canonical way such nonlinear operations may be performed. Consequently, the choice in such branchings has to come from extraneous considerations.',

It is shown that Lorentzian symmetry is recovered and an energy-momentum 4-vector is obtained. In particular, the result is consistent with the Bondi-Sachs energy-momentum at a retarded time. The quasilocal mass in [7] and [8] is defined by minimizing quasilocal energy among admissible isometric embeddings and observers. The solvability of the Euler-Lagrange equation for this variational problem is also discussed in both the asymptotically flat and asymptotically null cases. Assuming analyticity, the equation can be solved and the solution is locally minimizing in all orders. In particular, this produces an optimal reference hypersurface in the Minkowski space for the spatial or null exterior region of an asymptotically flat spacetime.',

In this short note, we try to address this issue, by extending the F_2-valued multi-graded link Floer homology theory to 2^ Z-valued theories. A grid diagram representing a link gives rise to a chain complex over F_2, whose homology is related to the multi-graded hat version of link Floer homology of that link over F_2. A sign refinement of the chain complex exists, and for knots, we establish that the sign refinement does indeed correspond to the sign assignment for the hat version of the knot Floer homology. For links, we create 2^ sign assignments on the grid diagrams, and show that they are related to the 2^ multi-graded hat versions of link Floer homology over Z, and one of them corresponds to the existing sign refinement of the grid chain complex.',

	{'abstract': u'Given an algebraic theory which can be described by a (possibly symmetric) operad , we propose a definition of the emph (or emph) of the theory, in which equations that hold strictly for -algebras hold only up to coherent isomorphism. This generalizes the theories of monoidal categories and symmetric monoidal categories, and several related notions defined in the literature. Using this definition, we generalize the result that every monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict monoidal category, and show that the "strictification" functor has an interesting universal property, being left adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of strict -categories to the category of weak -categories. We further show that the categorification obtained is independent of our choice of presentation for , and extend some of our results to many-sorted theories, using multicategories.',

	{'abstract': u'The inspection of residuals is a fundamental step to investigate the quality of adjustment of a parametric model to data. For spatial point processes, the concept of residuals has been recently proposed by Baddeley et al. (2005) as an empirical counterpart of the equation for marked Gibbs point processes. The present paper focuses on stationary marked Gibbs point processes and deals with asymptotic properties of residuals for such processes. In particular, the consistency and the asymptotic normality are obtained for a wide class of residuals including the classical ones (raw residuals, inverse residuals, Pearson residuals). Based on these asymptotic results, we define goodness-of-fit tests with Type-I error theoretically controlled. One of these tests constitutes an extension of the quadrat counting test widely used to test the null hypothesis of a homogeneous Poisson point process.',

	{'abstract': u"Loewner Theory is a deep technique in Complex Analysis affording a basis for many further important developments such as the proof of famous Bieberbach's conjecture and well-celebrated Schramm's Stochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE). It provides analytic description of expanding domains dynamics in the plane. Two cases have been developed in the classical theory, namely the and the Loewner evolutions, referring to the associated families of holomorphic self-mappings being normalized at an internal or boundary point of the reference domain, respectively. Recently there has been introduced a new approach [arXiv:0807.1594v1, arXiv:0807.1715v1, arXiv:0902.3116v1] bringing together, and containing as quite special cases, radial and chordal variants of Loewner Theory. In the framework of this approach we address the question what kind of systems of simply connected domains can be described by means of Loewner chains of chordal type. As an answer to this question we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of simply connected domains to be the range of a generalized Loewner chain of chordal type. We also provide an easy-to-check geometric sufficient condition for that. In addition, we obtain analogous results for the less general case of chordal Loewner evolution considered by I.A.Aleksandrov, S.T.Aleksandrov and V.V.Sobolev, 1983; V.V.Goryainov and I.Ba, 1992; R.O.Bauer, 2005 [arXiv:math/0306130v1].",

Most techniques for the construction of such symbolic models have two main drawbacks: either they can only be applied to restrictive classes of systems, or they require the exact computation of reachable sets. In this paper, we propose a new abstraction technique that is applicable to any smooth control system as long as we are only interested in its behavior in a compact set. Moreover, the exact computation of reachable sets is not required. The effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by synthesizing a controller to steer a vehicle.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study the ring of combinatorial convex polytopes. We introduce the algebra of operators generated by the operators that send an -dimensional polytope to the sum of all its -dimensional faces. It turns out that is isomorphic to the universal Leibnitz-Hopf algebra with the antipode . Using the operators we build the generalized -polynomial, which is a ring homomorphism from to the ring of quasi-symmetric functions with coefficients in . The images of two polytopes coincide if and only if their flag -vectors are equal. We describe the image of this homomorphism over the integers and prove that over the rationals it is a free polynomial algebra with dimension of the -th graded component equal to the -th Fibonacci number. This gives a representation of the Fibonacci series as an infinite product. The homomorphism is an isomorphism on the graded group generated by the polytopes introduced by Bayer and Billera to find the linear span of flag -vectors of convex polytopes. This gives the group a structure of the ring isomorphic to . We show that the ring of polytopes has a natural Hopf comodule structure over the Rota-Hopf algebra of posets. As a corollary we build a ring homomorphism such that , where is the Ehrenborg quasi-symmetric function.',

These models are reexamined in the light of Freidlin and Wentzell's large deviation approach of randomly perturbed dynamical systems. Assuming that some of their results still hold under slightly relaxed conditions, the metastability property is derived for both systems. A Lyapunov function exhibited by Antunes et al. is next identified with the quasipotential associated with a slightly modified, asymptotically reversible, Markovian perturbation of the same dynamical system. Another interpretation, in terms of entropy dissipation, of this Lyapunov function is finally given. The argument extends to another, similar but closed model.",

We impose minimal requirements on the maps we consider, and obtain partial results for any continuous map on a compact metric space. In order to obtain complete results, the primary hypothesis we require is that the functions be continuously differentiable. This makes rigorous the general paradigm of reducing questions regarding the multifractal formalism to questions regarding the thermodynamic formalism. These results hold for a broad class of measurable potentials, which includes (but is not limited to) continuous functions.

	{'abstract': u'Extending results of Oh--Zumbrun and Johnson--Zumbrun for parabolic conservation laws, we show that spectral stability implies nonlinear stability for spatially periodic viscous roll wave solutions of the one-dimensional St. Venant equations for shallow water flow down an inclined ramp. The main new issues to be overcome are incomplete parabolicity and the nonconservative form of the equations, which leads to undifferentiated quadratic source terms that cannot be handled using the estimates of the conservative case. The first is resolved by treating the equations in the more favorable Lagrangian coordinates, for which one can obtain large-amplitude nonlinear damping estimates similar to those carried out by Mascia--Zumbrun in the related shock wave case, assuming only symmetrizability of the hyperbolic part. The second is resolved by the observation that, similarly as in the relaxation and detonation cases, sources occurring in nonconservative components experience greater than expected decay, comparable to that experienced by a differentiated source.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyse the prequential plug-in codes relative to one-parameter exponential families M. We show that if data are sampled i.i.d. from some distribution outside M, then the redundancy of any plug-in prequential code grows at rate larger than 1/2 ln(n) in the worst case. This means that plug-in codes, such as the Rissanen-Dawid ML code, may behave inferior to other important universal codes such as the 2-part MDL, Shtarkov and Bayes codes, for which the redundancy is always 1/2 ln(n) + O(1). However, we also show that a slight modification of the ML plug-in code, "almost" in the model, does achieve the optimal redundancy even if the the true distribution is outside M.',

	{'abstract': u'A simple model to handle the flow of people in emergency evacuation situations is considered: at every point x, the velocity U(x) that individuals at x would like to realize is given. Yet, the incompressibility constraint prevents this velocity field to be realized and the actual velocity is the projection of the desired one onto the set of admissible velocities. Instead of looking at a microscopic setting (where individuals are represented by rigid discs), here the macroscopic approach is investigated, where the unknwon is the evolution of the density . If a gradient structure is given, say U is the opposite of the gradient of D where D is, for instance, the distance to the exit door, the problem is presented as a Gradient Flow in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. The functional which gives the Gradient Flow is neither finitely valued (since it takes into account the constraints on the density), nor geodesically convex, which requires for an ad-hoc study of the convergence of a discrete scheme.',

	{'abstract': u"The minimum mean square error of the estimation of a non Gaussian signal where observed from an additive white Gaussian noise channel's output, is analyzed. First, a quite general time-continuous channel model is assumed for which the behavior of the non-Gaussianess of the channel's output for small signal to noise ratio q, is proved. Then, It is assumed that the channel input's signal is composed of a (normalized) sum of N narrowband, mutually independent waves. It is shown that if N goes to infinity, then for any fixed q (no mater how big) both CMMSE and MMSE converge to the signal energy at a rate which is proportional to the inverse of N. Finally, a known result for the MMSE in the one-dimensional case, for small q, is used to show that all the first four terms in the Taylor expansion of the non-Gaussianess of the channel's output equal to zero.",

	{'abstract': u'Starting from an abstract setting for the Lueders - von Neumann quantum measurement process and its interpretation as a probability conditionalization rule in a non-Boolean event structure, the author derived a certain generalization of operator algebras in a preceding paper. This is an order-unit space with some specific properties. It becomes a Jordan operator algebra under a certain set of additional conditions, but does not own a multiplication operation in the most general case. A major objective of the present paper is the search for such examples of the structure mentioned above that do not stem from Jordan operator algebras; first natural candidates are matrix algebras over the octonions and other nonassociative rings. Therefore, the case when a nonassociative commutative multiplication exists is studied without assuming that it satisfies the Jordan condition. The characteristics of the resulting algebra are analyzed. This includes the uniqueness of the spectral resolution as well as a criterion for its existence, subalgebras that are Jordan algebras, associative subalgebras, and more different levels of compatibility than occurring in standard quantum mechanics. However, the paper cannot provide the desired example, but contribute to the search by the identification of some typical differences between the potential examples and the Jordan operator algebras and by negative results concerning some first natural candidates. The possibility that no such example exists cannot be ruled out. However, this would result in an unexpected new characterization of Jordan operator algebras, which would have a significant impact on quantum axiomatics since some customary axioms (e.g., powerassociativity or the sum postulate for observables) might turn out to be redundant then.',

Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? The answer is ``yes'' but the literature offers many reasons why this is the correct answer. The present paper argues that the most common reasoning found in introductory statistics texts, depending on making a number of ``obvious'' or ``natural'' assumptions and then computing a conditional probability, is a classical example of solution driven science. The best reason to switch is to be found in von Neumann's minimax theorem from game theory, rather than in Bayes' theorem.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we begin the study of the relationship between the local Gromov-Witten theory of Calabi-Yau rank two bundles over the projective line and the theory of integrable hierarchies. We first of all construct explicitly, in a large number of cases, the Hamiltonian dispersionless hierarchies that govern the full descendent genus zero theory. Our main tool is the application of Dubrovin\'s formalism, based on associativity equations, to the known results on the genus zero theory from local mirror symmetry and localization. The hierarchies we find are apparently new, with the exception of the resolved conifold O(-1) + O(-1) -&gt; P1 in the equivariantly Calabi-Yau case. For this example the relevant dispersionless system turns out to be related to the long-wave limit of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice. This identification provides us with a complete procedure to reconstruct the dispersive hierarchy which should conjecturally be related to the higher genus theory of the resolved conifold. We give a complete proof of this conjecture for genus g&lt;=1; our methods are based on establishing, analogously to the case of KdV, a "quasi-triviality" property for the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy at the leading order of the dispersive expansion. We furthermore provide compelling evidence in favour of the resolved conifold/Ablowitz-Ladik correspondence at higher genus by testing it successfully in the primary sector for g=2.',

One uses skein theory: you resolve each crossing of the link as a linear combination of things that don't cross, until you eventually get a linear combination of links with no crossings, which you turn into a polynomial. The other uses quantum groups: you construct a functor from a topological category to some category of representations in such a way that (directed framed) links get sent to endomorphisms of the trivial representation, which are just rational functions. Certain instances of these two constructions give rise to essentially the same invariants, but when one carefully matches them there is a minus sign that seems out of place. We discuss exactly how the constructions match up in the case of the Jones polynomial, and where the minus sign comes from.

	{'abstract': u'The present paper produces examples of Gauss diagram formulae for virtual knot invariants which have no analogue in the classical knot case. These combinatorial formulae contain additional information about how a subdiagram is embedded in a virtual knot diagram. The additional information comes from the second author\'s recently discovered notion of parity. For a parity of flat virtual knots, the new combinatorial formulae are Kauffman finite-type invariants. However, many of the combinatorial formulae possess exotic properties. It is shown that there exists an integer valued virtualization invariant combinatorial formula of order n for every n (i.e. it is stable under the map which changes the direction of one arrow but preserves the sign). Hence, it is not of Goussarov-Polyak-Viro finite-type. Moreover, every homogeneous Polyak-Viro combinatorial formula admits a decomposition into an "even" part and an "odd" part. For the Gaussian parity, neither part of the formula is of GPV finite-type when it is nonconstant on the set of classical knots. In addition, eleven new non-trivial combinatorial formulae of order 2 are presented which are not of GPV finite-type.',

The variational equations of motion which follow for the same system by assuming the validity of a specific variational action principle, in which the non-holonomic constraint is implemented by means of the multiplication rule in the calculus of variations are also considered. It is shown that these two types of equations of motion are not compatible in a space of dimension N greater than or equal to 3, if the constraint is genuinely non-holonomic.

	{'abstract': u'HIV dynamical models are often based on non-linear systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which do not have analytical solution. Introducing random effects in such models leads to very challenging non-linear mixed-effects models. To avoid the numerical computation of multiple integrals involved in the likelihood, we propose a hierarchical likelihood (h-likelihood) approach, treated in the spirit of a penalized likelihood. We give the asymptotic distribution of the maximum h-likelihood estimators (MHLE) for fixed effects, a result that may be relevant in a more general setting. The MHLE are slightly biased but the bias can be made negligible by using a parametric bootstrap procedure. We propose an efficient algorithm for maximizing the h-likelihood. A simulation study, based on a classical HIV dynamical model, confirms the good properties of the MHLE. We apply it to the analysis of a clinical trial.',

	{'abstract': u'Interference alignment is a transmission technique for exploiting all available degrees of freedom in the interference channel with an arbitrary number of users. Most prior work on interference alignment, however, neglects interference from other nodes in the network not participating in the alignment operation. This paper proposes three generalizations of interference alignment for the multiple-antenna interference channel with multiple users that account for colored noise, which models uncoordinated interference. First, a minimum interference-plus-noise leakage algorithm is presented, and shown to be equivalent to previous subspace methods when noise is spatially white or negligible. A joint minimum mean squared error design is then proposed that jointly optimizes the transmit precoders and receive spatial filters, whereas previous designs neglect the receive spatial filter. This algorithm is shown to be a generalization of previous joint MMSE designs for other system configurations such as the broadcast channel. Finally, a maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio algorithm is developed that is proven to converge, unlike previous maximum SINR algorithms. The latter two designs are shown to have increased complexity due to non-orthogonal precoders, more required iterations, or more channel state knowledge than the min INL or subspace methods. The sum throughput performance of these algorithms is simulated in the context of a network with uncoordinated co-channel interferers not participating in the alignment protocol. It is found that a network with cochannel interference can benefit from employing precoders designed to consider that interference, but in some cases, ignoring the co-channel interference is advantageous.',

To mitigate this performance loss, we propose an efficient algorithm, which is based on an i.i.d. Gaussian model for the distortion caused by these impairments.

	{'abstract': u'All known examples of nontrivial homogeneous Ricci solitons are left-invariant metrics on simply connected solvable Lie groups whose Ricci operator is a multiple of the identity modulo derivations (called solsolitons, and nilsolitons in the nilpotent case). The tools from geometric invariant theory used to study Einstein solvmanifolds, turned out to be useful in the study of solsolitons as well. We prove that, up to isometry, any solsoliton can be obtained via a very simple construction from a nilsoliton together with any abelian Lie algebra of symmetric derivations of its metric Lie algebra. The following uniqueness result is also obtained: a given solvable Lie group can admit at most one solsoliton up to isometry and scaling. As an application, solsolitons of dimension at most 4 are classified.',

	{'abstract': u"A theorem of L. Caffarelli implies the existence of a map pushing forward a source Gaussian measure to a target measure which is more log-concave than the source one, which contracts Euclidean distance (in fact, Caffarelli showed that the optimal-transport Brenier map is a contraction in this case). We generalize this result to more general source and target measures, using a condition on the third derivative of the potential, using two different proofs. The first uses a map , whose inverse is constructed as a flow along an advection field associated to an appropriate heat-diffusion process. The contraction property is then reduced to showing that log-concavity is preserved along the corresponding diffusion semi-group, by using a maximum principle for parabolic PDE. In particular, Caffarelli's original result immediately follows by using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the Pr 'ekopa--Leindler Theorem. The second uses the map by generalizing Caffarelli's argument, employing in addition further results of Caffarelli. As applications, we obtain new correlation and isoperimetric inequalities.",

	{'abstract': u'The main aim of this paper is twofold. First we generalize, in a novel way, most of the known non-vanishing results for the derivatives of the Riemann zeta function by establishing the existence of an infinite sequence of regions in the right half-plane where these derivatives cannot have any zeros; and then, in the rare regions of the complex plane that do contain zeros of the k-th derivative of the zeta function, we describe a unexpected phenomenon, which implies great regularities in their zero distributions. In particular, we prove sharp estimates for the number of zeros in each of these new critical strips, and we explain how they converge, in a very precise, periodic fashion, to their central, critical lines, as k increases. This not only shows that the zeros are not randomly scattered to the right of the line Re(s)=1, but that, in many respects, their two-dimensional distribution eventually becomes much simpler and more predictable than the one-dimensional behavior of the zeros of the zeta function on the line Re(s)=1/2.',

	{'abstract': u'We show how the description of a shear-free ray congruence in Minkowski space as an evolving family of semi-conformal mappings can naturally be formulated on a finite graph. For this, we introduce the notion of holomorphic function on a graph. On a regular coloured graph of degree three, we recover the space-time picture. In the spirit of twistor theory, where a light ray is the more fundamental object from which space-time points should be derived, the line graph, whose points are the edges of the original graph, should be considered as the basic object. The Penrose twistor correspondence is discussed in this context.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study the motion of spirals by mean curvature type motion in the (two dimensional) plane. Our motivation comes from dislocation dynamics; in this context, spirals appear when a screw dislocation line reaches the surface of a crystal. The first main result of this paper is a comparison principle for the corresponding parabolic quasi-linear equation. As far as motion of spirals are concerned, the novelty and originality of our setting and results come from the fact that, first, the singularity generated by the attached end point of spirals is taken into account for the first time, and second, spirals are studied in the whole space. Our second main result states that the Cauchy problem is well-posed in the class of sub-linear weak (viscosity) solutions. We also explain how to get the existence of smooth solutions when initial data satisfy an additional compatibility condition.',

Our fundamental results are obtained in the particular subclass of those 8-dimensional quadratic flexible real division algebras. We give a new process which generalizes that of Cayley-Dickson and which allows the obtaining of a new family of eight-dimensional quadratic flexible real division algebras. We give examples of 8-dimensional quadratic flexible real division algebras which cannot be obtained by this first process of duplication and by means of a second process, which consists in making an appropriate deformation of the product of the octonion algebra, we determine these last ones and we resolve the isomorphism problem. Among the eight-dimensional quadratic flexible real division algebras, we study those which possess a nontrivial derivation by mean of the generalized Cayley-Dickson process. We also give examples where the group of automorphisms is trivial, and characterize the algebras whose group of automorphisms is not trivial. This brings to light the unlimitedness of this subclass of algebras.',

Under natural conditions on the node position distributions and signal attenuation, we prove convergence in probability of the average per-user capacity C_Sigma/n to 1/2 E log(1 + 2SNR). The achievability result follows directly from results based on an interference alignment scheme presented in recent work of Nazer et al. Our main contribution comes through the converse result, motivated by ideas of `bottleneck links' developed in recent work of Jafar. An information theoretic argument gives a capacity bound on such bottleneck links, and probabilistic counting arguments show there are sufficiently many such links to tightly bound the sum-capacity of the whole network.",

	{'abstract': u'The convergence of U-statistics has been intensively studied for estimators based on families of i.i.d. random variables and variants of them. In most cases, the independence assumption is crucial [Lee90, de99]. When dealing with Feynman-Kac and other interacting particle systems of Monte Carlo type, one faces a new type of problem. Namely, in a sample of N particles obtained through the corresponding algorithms, the distributions of the particles are correlated -although any finite number of them is asymptotically independent with respect to the total number N of particles. In the present article, exploiting the fine asymptotics of particle systems, we prove convergence theorems for U-statistics in this framework.',

	{'abstract': u"Automorphism groups of locally finite trees provide a large class of examples of simple totally disconnected locally compact groups. It is desirable to understand the connections between the global and local structure of such a group. Topologically, the local structure is given by the commensurability class of a vertex stabiliser; on the other hand, the action on the tree suggests that the local structure should correspond to the local action of a stabiliser of a vertex on its neighbours. We study the interplay between these different aspects for the special class of groups satisfying Tits' independence property. We show that such a group has few open subgroups if and only if it acts locally primitively. Moreover, we show that it always admits many germs of automorphisms which do not extend to automorphisms, from which we deduce a negative answer to a question by George Willis. Finally, under suitable assumptions, we compute the full group of germs of automorphisms; in some specific cases, these turn out to be simple and compactly generated, thereby providing a new infinite family of examples which generalise Neretin's group of spheromorphisms. Our methods describe more generally the abstract commensurator group for a large family of self-replicating profinite branch groups.",

The simplest and commonly assumed approach is to quantize each measurement independently. In this paper, we show that if instead an th order quantization scheme with the same output alphabet is used to quantize , then there is an alternative recovery method via Sobolev dual frames which guarantees a reduction of the approximation error by a factor of for any , if .

The BSEs and BSDEs are governed by drivers and respectively. The new feature of this paper is that they may be non-Lipschitz in z. For the convergence results it is assumed that the BSEs are based on d-dimensional random walks approximating the d-dimensional Brownian motion W underlying the BSDE and that converges to f. Conditions are given under which for any bounded terminal condition for the BSDE, there exist bounded terminal conditions for the sequence of BSEs converging to , such that the corresponding solutions converge to the solution of the limiting BSDE. An important special case is when and f are convex in z. We show that in this situation, the solutions of the BSEs converge to the solution of the BSDE for every uniformly bounded sequence converging to . As a consequence, one obtains that the BSDE is robust in the sense that if is close to in distribution, then the solution of the Nth BSE is close to the solution of the BSDE in distribution too.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a family of n-dimensional diffusions, taking values in the unit simplex of vectors with nonnegative coordinates that add up to one. These processes satisfy stochastic differential equations which are similar to the ones for the classical Wright-Fisher diffusions, except that the "mutation rates" are now nonpositive. This model, suggested by Aldous, appears in the study of a conjectured diffusion limit for a Markov chain on Cladograms. The striking feature of these models is that the boundary is not reflecting, and we kill the process once it hits the boundary. We derive the explicit exit distribution from the simplex and probabilistic bounds on the exit time. We also prove that these processes can be viewed as a "stochastic time-reversal" of a Wright-Fisher process of increasing dimensions and conditioned at a random time. A key idea in our proofs is a skew-product construction using certain one-dimensional diffusions called Bessel-square processes of negative dimensions, which have been recently introduced by Going-Jaeschke and Yor.',

	{'abstract': u"Let a_1,...,a_k satisfy a_1+...+a_k=1 and suppose a k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices satisfies the following property; in any partition of its vertices into k sets A_1,...,A_k of sizes a_1*n,...,a_k*n, the number of edges intersecting A_1,...,A_k is the number one would expect to find in a random k-uniform hypergraph. Can we then infer that H is quasi-random? We show that the answer is negative if and only if a_1=...=a_k=1/k. This resolves an open problem raised in 1991 by Chung and Graham [J. AMS '91]. While hypergraphs satisfying the property corresponding to a_1=...=a_k=1/k are not necessarily quasi-random, we manage to find a characterization of the hypergraphs satisfying this property. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that (essentially) there is a unique non quasi-random hypergraph satisfying this property. The proofs combine probabilistic and algebraic arguments with results from the theory of association schemes.",

	{'abstract': u'In a bi-directional relay channel, a pair of nodes wish to exchange independent messages over a shared wireless half-duplex channel with the help of relays. Recent work has mostly considered information theoretic limits of the bi-directional relay channel with two terminal nodes (or end users) and one relay. In this work we consider bi-directional relaying with one base station, multiple terminal nodes and one relay, all of which operate in half-duplex modes. We assume that each terminal node communicates with the base-station in a bi-directional fashion through the relay and do not place any restrictions on the channels between the users, relays and base-stations; that is, each node has a direct link with every other node. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) the introduction of four new temporal protocols which fully exploit the two-way nature of the data and outperform simple routing or multi-hop communication schemes by carefully combining network coding, random binning and user cooperation which exploit over-heard and own-message side information, 2) derivations of inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the discrete-memoryless multi-pair two-way network, and 3) a numerical evaluation of the obtained achievable rate regions and outer bounds in Gaussian noise which illustrate the performance of the proposed protocols compared to simpler schemes, to each other, to the outer bounds, which highlight the relative gains achieved by network coding, random binning and compress-and-forward-type cooperation between terminal nodes.',

One can define convergence in terms of counting homomorphisms from fixed graphs into members of the sequence (left-convergence), or counting homomorphisms into fixed graphs (right-convergence). Under appropriate conditions, these two ways of defining convergence was proved to be equivalent in the dense case by Borgs, Chayes, Lov 'asz, S 'os and Vesztergombi. In this paper a similar equivalence is established in the bounded degree case. In terms of statistical physics, the implication that left convergence implies right convergence means that for a left-convergent sequence, partition functions of a large class of statistical physics models converge.

	{'abstract': u'We consider the estimation of a sparse parameter vector from measurements corrupted by white Gaussian noise. Our focus is on unbiased estimation as a setting under which the difficulty of the problem can be quantified analytically. We show that there are infinitely many unbiased estimators but none of them has uniformly minimum mean-squared error. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the Barankin bound, which describes the performance achievable by unbiased estimators. These bounds are used to predict the threshold region of practical estimators.',

	{'abstract': u'Using some resolution of singularities and oscillatory integral methods in conjunction with appropriate damping and interpolation techniques, L^p boundedness theorems for p &gt; 2 are obtained for maximal operators over a wide range of hypersurfaces. These estimates are sharp in many situations, including the convex hypersurfaces of finite line type considered by Iosevich, Sawyer, and others. As a corollary, we also give a generalization of the result of Sogge and Stein that for some finite p the maximal operator corresponding to a hypersurface whose Gaussian curvature does not vanish to infinite order is bounded on L^p. Analogous estimates are proven for Fourier transforms of surface measures, and these are sharp for the same hypersurfaces as the maximal operators.',

We propose to construct positive almost periodic discrete sets as an almost periodic perturbation of a full rank discrete lattice. Also we prove that each almost periodic discrete set on the real axes is an almost periodic perturbation of some arithmetic progression. Next, we consider signed almost periodic discrete sets, i.e., when the signed measure with masses at points of a discrete set is almost periodic. We construct a signed discrete set that is not almost periodic, while the corresponding signed measure is almost periodic in the sense of distributions. Also, we construct a signed almost periodic discrete set such that the measure with masses +1 at all points of the set is not almost periodic.',

The method highlights and exploits the underlying manifold structure of the Pareto sets, approximating Pareto optima by means of simplicial complexes. The method distinguishes the hierarchy between singular set, Pareto critical set and stable Pareto critical set, and can handle the problem of superposition of local Pareto fronts, occurring in the general nonconvex case. Furthermore, a quadratic convergence result in a suitable set-wise sense is proven and tested in a number of numerical examples.',

	{'abstract': u'We shall prove new contraction properties of general transportation costs along nonnegative measure-valued solutions to Fokker-Planck equations in , when the drift is a monotone (or -monotone) operator. A new duality approach to contraction estimates has been developed: it relies on the Kantorovich dual formulation of optimal transportation problems and on a variable-doubling technique. The latter is used to derive a new comparison property of solutions of the backward Kolmogorov (or dual) equation. The advantage of this technique is twofold: it directly applies to distributional solutions without requiring stronger regularity and it extends the Wasserstein theory of Fokker-Planck equations with gradient drift terms started by Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (1998) to more general costs and monotone drifts, without requiring the drift to be a gradient and without assuming any growth conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that the description of topological and geometric properties of bisectors in normed spaces is a non-trivial subject. In this paper we introduce the concept of bounded representation of bisectors in finite dimensional real Banach spaces. This useful notion combines the concepts of bisector and shadow boundary of the unit ball, both corresponding with the same spatial direction. The bounded representation visualizes the connection between the topology of bisectors and shadow boundaries (Lemma 1) and gives the possibility to simplify and to extend some known results on radial projections of bisectors. Our main result (Theorem 1) says that in the manifold case the topology of the closed bisector and the topology of its bounded representation are the same; they are closed, -dimensional balls embedded in Euclidean -space in the standard way.',

	{'abstract': u'To each algebra over the complex numbers we associate a sequence of abelian groups in a contravariant functorial way. In degree (m-1) we have the m-summable Fredholm modules over the algebra modulo stable m-summable perturbations. These new finitely summable K-homology groups pair with cyclic homology and algebraic K-theory. In the case of cyclic homology the pairing is induced by the Chern-Connes character. The pairing between algebraic K-theory and finitely summable K-homology is induced by the Connes-Karoubi multiplicative character.',

	{'abstract': u"It is well known that at distances shorter than Planck length, no length measurements are possible. The Volovich hypothesis asserts that at sub-Planckian distances and times, spacetime itself has a non-Archimedean geometry. We discuss the structure of elementary particles, their classification, and their conformal symmetry under this hypothesis. Specifically, we investigate the projective representations of the -adic Poincar ' and Galilean groups, using a new variant of the Mackey machine for projective unitary representations of semidirect products of locally compact and second countable (lcsc) groups. We construct the conformal spacetime over -adic fields and discuss the imbedding of the -adic Poincar ' group into the -adic conformal group. Finally, we show that the massive and so called eventually masssive particles of the Poincar ' group do not have conformal symmetry. The whole picture bears a close resemblance to what happens over the field of real numbers, but with some significant variations.",

	{'abstract': u'We study two classical problems in graph Ramsey theory, that of determining the Ramsey number of bounded-degree graphs and that of estimating the induced Ramsey number for a graph with a given number of vertices. The Ramsey number r(H) of a graph H is the least positive integer N such that every two-coloring of the edges of the complete graph contains a monochromatic copy of H. A famous result of Chv \'atal, R "dl, Szemer \'edi and Trotter states that there exists a constant c( Delta) such that r(H) leq c( Delta) n for every graph H with n vertices and maximum degree Delta. The important open question is to determine the constant c( Delta). The best results, both due to Graham, R "dl and Ruci \'nski, state that there are constants c and c\' such that 2^ leq c( Delta) leq 2^. We improve this upper bound, showing that there is a constant c for which c( Delta) leq 2^. The induced Ramsey number r_(H) of a graph H is the least positive integer N for which there exists a graph G on N vertices such that every two-coloring of the edges of G contains an induced monochromatic copy of H. Erd Hs conjectured the existence of a constant c such that, for any graph H on n vertices, r_(H) leq 2^. We move a step closer to proving this conjecture, showing that r_ (H) leq 2^. This improves upon an earlier result of Kohayakawa, Pr "mel and R "dl by a factor of log n in the exponent.',

	{'abstract': u'Algorithms based on multiple decoding attempts of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes have recently attracted new attention. Choosing decoding candidates based on rate-distortion (R-D) theory, as proposed previously by the authors, currently provides the best performance-versus-complexity trade-off. In this paper, an analysis based on the rate-distortion exponent (RDE) is used to directly minimize the exponential decay rate of the error probability. This enables rigorous bounds on the error probability for finite-length RS codes and leads to modest performance gains. As a byproduct, a numerical method is derived that computes the rate-distortion exponent for independent non-identical sources. Analytical results are given for errors/erasures decoding.',

	{'abstract': u"Lower bounds involving -divergences between the underlying probability measures are proved for the minimax risk in estimation problems. Our proofs just use simple convexity facts. Special cases and straightforward corollaries of our bounds include well known inequalities for establishing minimax lower bounds such as Fano's inequality, Pinsker's inequality and inequalities based on global entropy conditions. Two applications are provided: a new minimax lower bound for the reconstruction of convex bodies from noisy support function measurements and a different proof of a recent minimax lower bound for the estimation of a covariance matrix.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider self-affine tilings in the Euclidean space and the associated tiling dynamical systems, namely, the translation action on the orbit closure of the given tiling. We investigate the spectral properties of the system. It turns out that the presence of the discrete component depends on the algebraic properties of the eigenvalues of the expansion matrix for the tiling. Assuming that is diagonalizable over and all its eigenvalues are algebraic conjugates of the same multiplicity, we show that the dynamical system has a relatively dense discrete spectrum if and only if it is not weakly mixing, and if and only if the spectrum of is a "Pisot family". Moreover, this is equivalent to the Meyer property of the associated discrete set of "control points" for the tiling.',

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that the moduli space of flat connections on a trivial principal bundle MxG, where G is a connected Lie group, is isomorphic to the representation variety Hom( pi_1(M), G)/G. For a tiling T, viewed as a marked copy of R^d, we define a new kind of bundle called pattern equivariant bundle over T and consider the set of all such bundles. This is a topological invariant of the tiling space induced by T, which we call PREP(T), and we show that it is isomorphic to the direct limit lim_ Hom( pi_1( Gamma_n), G)/G, where Gamma_n are the approximants to the tiling space and f_n are maps between them. G can be any group. As an example, we choose G to be the symmetric group S_3 and we calculate this direct limit for the Period Doubling tiling and its double cover, the Thue-Morse tiling, obtaining different results. This is the simplest topological invariant that can distinguish these two examples.',

	{'abstract': u"Szemeredi's regularity lemma can be viewed as a rough structure theorem for arbitrary dense graphs, decomposing such graphs into a structured piece (a partition into cells with edge densities), a small error (corresponding to irregular cells), and a uniform piece (the pseudorandom deviations from the edge densities). We establish an arithmetic regularity lemma that similarly decomposes bounded functions f : [N] -&gt; C, into a (well-equidistributed, virtual) -step nilsequence, an error which is small in L^2 and a further error which is miniscule in the Gowers U^-norm, where s is a positive integer. We then establish a complementary arithmetic counting lemma that counts arithmetic patterns in the nilsequence component of f. We provide a number of applications of these lemmas: a proof of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions, a proof of a conjecture of Bergelson, Host and Kra, and a generalisation of certain results of Gowers and Wolf. Our result is dependent on the inverse conjecture for the Gowers U^ norm, recently established for general s by the authors and T. Ziegler.",
